## Remarks

Contensis uses an optimistic concurrency versioning model. Rather than checking out entries and locking them we allow concurrent updating of entries. At the point in which you update an entry the version you pass in is checked to make sure it is the latest and no one else has created a newer version. If the version you pass in is the latest version then the entry will get updated. If you pass in a version which isn't now the latest then you will get a validation error (422) response.
