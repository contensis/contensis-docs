An asterisk can be specified as the key for an endpoint to handle all languages excluding any endpoint explicitly declared with a language. If no asterisk-keyed endpoint is specified then only the languages provided will be proxied.

If no host is provided for a URI that includes the domain, then the host header is automatically added on creation.
