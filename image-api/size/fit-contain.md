When the `fit=contain` parameter is used in conjunction with the `width` and `height` parameters then the image will be scaled to fit within the width / height boundaries without cropping, distorting or altering the aspect ratio. The image will be **scaled up** if it is smaller than the output size.

*The original image was 250px and has been scaled up to meet the dimensions specified. This results in a pixelated and blurry image.*
