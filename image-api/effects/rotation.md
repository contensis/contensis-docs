The `rotate` or `r` parameter allows you to rotate an image by any arbitrary angle in degrees. The value is an integer between 0 and 359, rotating the image clockwise. If the angle is not a multiple of 90 then a rectangular bounding box is added containing the rotated image and empty space, the background color can be specified by the `background` or `bg` parameter hex value.
