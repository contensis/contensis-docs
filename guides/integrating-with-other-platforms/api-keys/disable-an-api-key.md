1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar. The *Settings* menu will open revealing a number of options.
2.  Select **API keys** to open the *API Keys* list.
3.  Find the API key you want to disable in the list, and press the **Action** button denoted by the triple dot.
4.  Select **Edit** from the menu, the API key screen will open.
5.  Toggle the *API Key status* button to disable the API key.
6.  Click **Update API Key** to save your changes. The API key will now be listed as disabled.

**Warning:** Any application or website using this API key will expect it to be enabled to access its content.
