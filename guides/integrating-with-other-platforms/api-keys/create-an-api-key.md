If you want to use the Delivery API outside of a Contensis published site, or use the Management API, you'll need to generate an API key. Only users within the *API Key Administrators* security group can create API keys.

To create an API key:

1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar. The *Settings* menu will open, revealing a number of options.
2.  Select **API keys** to open the *API Keys* list.
3.  Press **New API Key**. The *Create a new API key* window will be displayed.
4.  Give the API key a name by filling in the *Name* field. Provide a description to help other administrators understand what the key is used for by populating the *Description* field.
5.  By default all new keys are enabled – use the toggle button to disable the key if required.
6.  Press **Create API Key**. The key will be generated and the *API Keys* list will display your new key.

**Note:** Once an API key has been created it needs to be [assigned to a role](/help-and-docs/user-guides/governance/roles-and-permissions/assign-an-api-key-to-a-role "Assign an API key to a role") to grant permission to the resources you want it to have access to.
