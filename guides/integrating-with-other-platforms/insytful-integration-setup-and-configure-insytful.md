## View your Insytful scan results in the entry editor

Any entry attached to a Site View node can use the Insytful integration. Open an entry, either through the entry listing or through Site View.

1.  With the entry open, locate the Insytful button in the editor toolbar.
2.  Opening the panel will enable you to view two sets of scan results:
    
    -   **Preview**: when running a scan from the preview tab, you are scanning the latest version of your entry with any recent changes.
    -   **Published**: if Insytful has scanned the node attached to the entry, you will receive the full set of scan data including SEO, Content Quality, Performance, and Accessibility.
    
3.  If you want to see the effect of any changes you make to your content, you can start a rescan from the preview panel at any time.
4.  If you want to navigate directly to your Insytful dashboard, you can do so by pressing the link in the footer of the panel.
