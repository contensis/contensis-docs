If you want to temporarily stop or pause updates to an integration being sent for a while then you can disable the webhook.

**Warning**: Disabling a webhook subscription will prevent any updates being sent to your webhook endpoint. Any events raised whilst disabled will not be captured or processed when the webhook is re-enabled.

## Disable a webhook from the listing

1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar.
2.  Select **Webhooks** from the settings menu to open the webhooks listing.
3.  Find the Webhook you want to disable in the list, and press the **Action** button denoted by the triple dot.
4.  Select **Disable** from the menu. A notification will be displayed confirming that the webhook has been disabled and the status will be updated in the listing.

## Disable a webhook from the editor

Alternatively, you can disable the webhook from the webhook editor.

1.  With a webhook opened for editing, open the *Information* panel from the toolbar.
2.  Press the **toggle button** to disable the webhook. The status will update.
3.  Press **Save** to disable the webhook. A confirmation notification will be displayed.
