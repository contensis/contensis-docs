Groups in Contensis are managed at an environment level. Groups can then be assigned to [roles](/help-and-docs/user-guides/governance/roles-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions-overview) to give users access to resources in Contensis. You'll need to be a system administrator to manage groups.

The groups listing can be found in the environment settings menu.

1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar. If you are a system administrator you'll see a menu section labelled *Environment Settings*.
2.  Select **Groups** from the menu to show the list of groups in your environment.
3.  Press the **New group** button. A new group window will be displayed.
4.  Enter a name for the group.
5.  Provide an optional description.
6.  Press **Add group** to confirm your choices. A notification will be displayed to confirm the creation of the group.

**Note:** If you want to add a series of groups in sequence, select the *Add another group checkbox* and the window will remain open to add a series of groups.
