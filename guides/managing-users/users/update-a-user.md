You can update a user's name or email address from the *Manage user* screen.

With the [*User listing*](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/user-management/users/view-a-list-of-users) screen displayed, select the user you want to edit by clicking on their username in the listing or by selecting the **Edit user** option from the *More actions* menu, which you can access by pressing the triple dot icon (**⋮**) next to the user. From this screen, you can do the following:

## Update name, email, and username

1.  Update the name, email address or username of the user.
2.  Press **Save** in the toolbar to save your changes.

## User avatar

The user avatar is not editable from the CMS. It originates from the avatar used in the Contensis Slack community. If that's unavailable, the avatar is pulled from the Gravatar.com account associated with the email address. In the event a user does not have a profile image stored with either of these services, their initials will be displayed.

## Account expiry

If you want to set a particular user account to expire on a specific day, you can set the *Set account to never expire* toggle to the off position. A date picker will be displayed, allowing you to specify the date on which the account should expire. Once the date is reached, the account will be [suspended](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/user-management/users/suspend-or-unsuspend-a-user) automatically.
