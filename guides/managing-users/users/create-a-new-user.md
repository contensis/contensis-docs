Users in Contensis are managed at an environment level, and are assigned to roles to give users access to resources in Contensis. You'll need to be a system administrator to manage users.

The users listing can be found in the environment settings menu.

1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar. If you are a system administrator you'll see a menu section labelled *Environment Settings*.
2.  Select **Users** from the menu to show a list of users in your organisation.
3.  Press the **New user** button. A new user window will be displayed.
4.  Provide an email address. A username will be generated from the first part of the email address. You can update it if necessary.
5.  You'll need to provide a password for the user to login for the first time. We force the user to change their password when logging in for the first time unless you choose otherwise.
6.  Provide an optional *First name* and *Surname*.
7.  Press **Add user** to confirm.

If you want to add a series of users in sequence, select the *Add another user checkbox* and the window will remain open to add a series of users.
