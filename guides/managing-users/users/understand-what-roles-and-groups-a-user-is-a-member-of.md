To view the details of a user's account, and to understand what roles and groups the user belongs to, you'll need to be a system administrator.

## View user details

With the *User listing* screen displayed:

-   Locate the user you want to view.
-   Select the user in the listing by pressing on their **username** or by selecting **Edit** from the *actions menu*.
-   The user details screen will be displayed, from where you can make [updates](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/user-management/users/update-a-user).

## Groups a user belongs to

From the user details screen, select the **Groups** tab from the tab bar to view the groups to which the user is assigned.

You can assign the user to a group using the **Assign groups** action in the top toolbar.

## Roles a user belongs to

From the user details screen, select the **Roles** tab from the tab bar to view the roles the user is assigned to.

You can edit the role that the user belongs to by pressing on the **role name** in the listing, or selecting the **View role** option in the more actions menu. You'll be redirected to the roles builder for the project that the role is part of.

Roles are created at project level. If you want to [add a user](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/governance/roles-and-permissions/assign-users-and-groups-to-a-role) to another role, you'll need to use the roles builder for the project you want to add them to.
