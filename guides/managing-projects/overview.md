A project is a repository or a container that holds all the content entries and assets of your site or application. It allows multiple users to create, edit, approve, and publish their content.

Contensis allows you to create multiple projects. The total number of projects you can create will depend on your license. Within a project, you can define your content model and create entries, webhooks, and a host of other features.

To access a project, you need to log in using your Contensis account details or through single sign-on. After logging in, you will see your projects in the project listing.
