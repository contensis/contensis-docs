To delete a project, you'll need to be a System Administrator.

1.  Press **Settings** in the sidebar.
2.  Select the **Danger zone** option in the settings menu that is displayed.
3.  Press the **Delete** button. A type-to-confirm window will be displayed.
4.  Enter the name of the project in the confirmation window. Once it is active, press **I understand, delete the project**. Your project will be permanently deleted.

**Warning:** Deleting a project is irreversible. Only do this if you are confident that you no longer require the project and its associated content types, entries, assets and webhooks.
