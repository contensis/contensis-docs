Only system administrators can create new projects in Contensis.

1.  From the project listing screen, press the **New project** button. A *Project setup* window will be displayed.
2.  Give your project a name, such as 'Website'. A sanitised API name will automatically be created from the project name you enter.
3.  You can add an optional description to distinguish the project in the listing.
4.  Choose an avatar colour for the project. When you are working with multiple projects, the initials of the project name and colour help to distinguish the project you are working on.
5.  Choose the default language for the project.
6.  If you are building a multilingual project, select any additional languages that you'll need.
7.  Press **Create**. The *Project setup* window will close, and you'll be redirected to your new project.
