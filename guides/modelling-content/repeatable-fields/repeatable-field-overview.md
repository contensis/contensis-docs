A repeatable field allows an author to create lists of values of the same field type in an entry. Once this option is enabled for a field, multiple items can be added, removed, and ordered in the repeated list.

## Examples

### A list of names

Perhaps you want a list of names of research paper contributors that exist outside of your organisation. Setting a text field to be repeatable allows you to enter multiple names.

### Opening hours

To create a list of opening hours, you could set up an opening hours [component](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/components/components-overview) containing days of the week and two fields for the *from* and *to* time. You could then set this component to be repeatable so your authors can easily enter a set of opening hours unique to your business.
