## Placeholder text

The placeholder property provides a short hint describing the expected value of a field. The hint will be displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

## Content guidelines

This property provides a hint to an author for the expected content that the field should contain. Content guidelines are shown below the field label, and are subsequently read by screen readers so keep the information short and concise.

The content guideline field supports basic markdown formatting including bold, italics and links. Where you need to provide longer guidelines please link to an appropriate styleguide.

## Size

This property allows you to change the size of the rendered field editor when creating an entry. It usually changes the height of the editor to allow more content to be seen at the same time without needing to scroll.

## Field visibility

The field visibility property determines if the field should be displayed in the collapsed state when the entry editor loads.
