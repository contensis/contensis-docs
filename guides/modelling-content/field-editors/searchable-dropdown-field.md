The searchable dropdown field editor provides a way to use keyword searches to filter down a large list of values that are set in the list values properties text box.

The type of dropdown displayed will depend on whether multiple selection is allowed.

Single selections allow a single value to be searched for and set – very similar to a standard dropdown menu, but with the addition of support for searches.

When multiple selection is, set each value selected is added as box with a cross icon which allows items to be removed from the list.
