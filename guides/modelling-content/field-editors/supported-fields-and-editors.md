Fields support a range of different editor types and properties. Depending on the type of field added to the content type and the editor that is chosen will result in different properties being available to configure.

A field editor is a user interface component that a content creator would use to input content inside the entry editor.

## Changing a field editor

With a content type open for editing:

1.  Select the field you want to change a field editor for and pick the **Editor** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2.  You will now be in the *Field Editor* panel. If there is more than one *Field Editor* available, choose an option from the dropdown, for example *Multiline Text*.
3.  You can now set any additional properties that the field editor supports, for example *Content guidelines,* in the boxes below the *Choose field editor* dropdown.
4.  Press **Save** and **Publish** for the additional field editors to be made available for the entries in your project.
