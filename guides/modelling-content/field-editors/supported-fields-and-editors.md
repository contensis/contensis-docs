A field editor is a user interface component that a content creator would use to input content inside the entry editor.

## Changing a field editor

With a content type open for editing:

1.  Select the field you want to change a field editor for and pick the **Editor** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2.  You will now be in the *Field Editor* panel. If there is more than one *Field Editor* available, choose an option from the dropdown, for example *Multiline Text*.
3.  You can now set any additional properties that the field editor supports, for example *Content guidelines,* in the boxes below the *Choose field editor* dropdown.
4.  Press **Save** and **Publish** for the additional field editors to be made available for the entries in your project.
