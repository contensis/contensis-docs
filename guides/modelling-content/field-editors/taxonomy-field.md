This editor allows you to bind a list of existing taxonomy nodes from the *Taxonomy Manager* to a field where one or more items are available for selection by an author.

This is an ideal field editor for centrally managing static values – such as categories, languages, or country lists – that may be used elsewhere in your project.

The taxonomy editor supports single and multiple selections. You can also specify a root taxonomy node from which values can be selected.
