The *number of characters* validation rule checks that the number of characters in a text field meets a minimum or maximum value or is between a range of values.

## How to set the validation

With a content type open for editing:

1.  Select the field you want to set a character count rule for and pick the **Validation** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2.  Choose one of the following options from the *Number of characters* dropdown:

**Between** allows you to set the minimum and maximum values for an expected character range.

**Minimum of** allows you to set an expected minimum value that needs to be met.

**Maximum of** allows you to set the maximum number of characters that can be entered.

3.  An alternative validation message can be added by entering it in the *Validation message* text box. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when published.
