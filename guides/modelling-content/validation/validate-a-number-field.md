The number validation checks the values of a field are within a specified range. You can define a range by specifying the *minimum* and the *maximum* values (the values are included in the range). Alternatively, you can specify only *minimum* or *maximum* value to set a limit on the minimum/maximum allowed value.

## How to set the validation

With a content type open for editing:

1.  Select the number or decimal field you want to set a validation rule for and select the **Validation** tab from the *Field Settings panel*.
2.  Set a value for the minimum, maximum, or both fields to set a range of values.
    
    -   **Minimum** allows you to set an expected minimum value that needs to be met. For example, *Requires a minimum value of 10.*
    -   **Maximum** allows you to set the maximum value that can be set in the field. For example, *Requires a maximum value of 100.*
    -   **Minimum and maximum** allows you to set a range of values that can be set in the field. For example, *Requires a value between 10-100.*
    

You can add an alternative validation message by entering it in the validation message text box for each value. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when published.
