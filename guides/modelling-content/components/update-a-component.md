## Update name

To update the name of your component, retype the name in the *Details* panel of the component.

**Note:** This will have no effect on the API Name. The API Name cannot be changed once it has been set.

You can update the description in the *Details* panel of the component. You will need to save and publish any changes for the component to be updated.
