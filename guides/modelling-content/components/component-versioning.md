All changes to a component are recorded in version history. The version number will depend on the [workflow state](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/components/component-workflow-states) that the component is in. When a component is first created its version number will be *0.1*.

## Saving a component

Each time a change is made to a component and saved, the minor version number is incremented and the changes are recorded in a version history.

## Publishing a component

When a component is ready for publishing, pressing **Publish** in the *Component builder* will change the major version number.
