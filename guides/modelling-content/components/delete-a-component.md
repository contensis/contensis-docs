A component can only be deleted once it is no longer in use. The option to delete a component will be disabled if it's currently in use, which is indicated by the [usage panel](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/components/find-out-where-a-component-is-being-used).  
To delete a component:

1.  Open the component you want to delete by selecting it in the *Component listing*.
2.  When the *Component builder* opens, press the **Action** button from the Component toolbar.
3.  Press **Delete** from the menu. A confirmation window will appear.
4.  To confirm deletion you will need to type the component name in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
5.  Press **I understand, delete the component.** The component will be permanently removed from your project.

**Warning:** Deleting a component is irreversible. Only do this if you are confident that the component is no longer required.
