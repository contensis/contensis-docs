If you want to understand the changes made to a content type or component, you can use the activity stream and version history features. These tools let you see who has made recent changes and view updates to the underlying JSON through a JSON diff view.

## Activity stream

The activity stream is found in the information panel of the content type builder. It shows recent minor and major changes, grouped by version number. Each entry highlights when the change was made and who made it.

## Version history

The version history is accessed from the actions menu in the content type or component builder. It displays the current content type or component alongside a selected previous version for comparison.

You can:

-   Navigate through changes using the navigation buttons above the view.
-   Switch the versions you want to compare using the version history panel.
-   View detailed differences in the JSON diff view.
