If you find yourself needing to produce a component that is very similar to an existing one, you can copy an existing component from the component builder. You'll need to be a member of the *Component Administrators* security group to do this.

1.  Open the component you want to copy by selecting it in the *Component listing*.
2.  When the *Component builder* opens, press the **Action** button from the component toolbar.
3.  Press **Copy** from the menu.
4.  The component will be copied and opened for editing. The new component will have '*\- copy*' appended to its name.
5.  You'll need to update the component name and API ID of your new component.
6.  Edit and update your component by [adding](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/components/add-fields-to-a-component) or [removing](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/components/remove-fields-from-a-component) fields.
