Components can be created and managed by a Systems Administrator or another user that is a member of a [role](/help-and-docs/guides/governing-content/roles-and-permissions/assign-and-remove-role-permissions) with sufficient [permissions](/help-and-docs/guides/modelling-content/components/component-permissions). To start creating components:

1.  Press **Content modelling** in the sidebar. The *Content modelling* drawer will open, revealing a number of options.
2.  Select **Components** to open the *Components listing*.
3.  Press **New component.** A *Create new component* window will be displayed.
4.  Give your component a name, such as "Social". The API name will automatically be created and sanitised from the component name you enter. You can add an optional description to distinguish the component in the listing.
5.  Press **Create** to create your new component. The *Component builder* will open so you can start [adding fields to your component](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/components/add-fields-to-a-component) from the *Toolbox*.

## After creation

Once your component is created, you can:

-   Add and configure fields to structure your component
-   [Arrange fields in a logical order](/help-and-docs/guides/modelling-content/components/reorder-fields-in-a-component)
-   Set [validation](/help-and-docs/guides/modelling-content/validation/overview) rules and other field properties
-   Save your component when configuration is complete
