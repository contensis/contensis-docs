Once created, components will always have one of the following workflow states: *Draft*, *Awaiting publish* or *Published*.

## Draft

When a component is created it will be in the *Draft* state until it has been published for the first time and will be highlighted in blue.

Another indication that the item is in draft is that it has no major version in its version number, such as *0.6*.

## Awaiting publish

When a component has been published at least once, and had further changes saved to it, the component will be *Awaiting publish* until it is published. It's effectively published and has a new draft state. Components that are *Awaiting publish* will be highlighted in yellow.

Another indication that the item is *Awaiting publish* is that it will have major *and* minor version numbers, such as *1.6*.

## Published

When a component is published and has had no further changes made to it, the component status will be *Published* and the highlight will be green.

Another indication that the item is in the *Published* state is that it only has a major number in its version number, such as *2.0*.
