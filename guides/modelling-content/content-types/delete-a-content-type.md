Deleting a content type will remove the content type as well as any entries that have been created – even if they are published.

1.  Open the content type you want to delete by selecting it in the *Content type listing* screen.
2.  When the *Content type builder* opens, press the **More actions** (⋮) button from the top toolbar.
3.  Press **Delete** from the menu. A confirmation window will appear.
4.  To confirm deletion you will need to type the content type name in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
5.  Press **I understand, delete the content type and its entries**. The content type and its entries will be permanently removed from your project.
