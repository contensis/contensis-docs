The content type builder provides a way for non technical users to build rich content models. However, there are times when it's helpful to view and amend the raw JSON created by the content type builder, or to copy the field data from one system to another.

You can easily switch between the JSON editor and the design view. Just follow these few steps:

1.  Open the content type for editing.
2.  Press the **Action** button from the Content type toolbar.
3.  Select **Switch to JSON view** / **Switch to design view** from the menu.
4.  The selected editor will be displayed.
