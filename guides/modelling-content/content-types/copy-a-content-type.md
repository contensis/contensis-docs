If you find yourself needing to produce a content type that is very similar to an exisiting one, you can copy a content type from the content type builder. You'll need to be a member of the *Content type Administrators* security group to do this.

1.  Open the content type you want to copy by selecting it in the *Content type listing*.
2.  When the *Content type builder* opens, press the **Action** button from the content type toolbar.
3.  Press **Copy** from the menu.
4.  The content type will be copied and opened for editing. The new content type will have '*\- copy*' appended to its name.
5.  You'll need to update the content type name and API ID for your new component.
6.  Edit and update your content type by [adding](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/content-types/add-fields-to-a-content-type) or [removing fields](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/content-types/remove-fields-from-a-content-type).
