To define a new type of content in Contensis you'll need to create a new content type. The creation of content types is restricted to users in the *Content Type Administrators* security group. Follow these steps to create a content type:

1.  Press **Content modelling** in the sidebar. The *Content modelling* drawer will open, revealing a number of options.
2.  Select **Content Types** to open the *Content Types Listing* screen.
3.  Press **New content type**. A *Create new content type* window will be displayed.
4.  Give your content type a name, such as 'Films'.
5.  The API name will automatically be created and sanitised from the content type name you enter.
6.  You can add an optional description to distinguish the content type in the listing.
7.  Press the **Create** button to create your new content type. The *Content type builder* will open so you can start [adding fields to your content type](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/content-types/add-fields-to-a-content-type).
