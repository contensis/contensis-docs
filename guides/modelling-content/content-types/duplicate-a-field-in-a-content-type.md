If you have a field in a content type – such as a composer – that you want to duplicate, you can do so from the actions menu.

1.  With the field in the content type selected, press on the more actions button to open the menu.
2.  Select the **Duplicate field** option. The field will be copied and displayed below the original with '-Copy' appended to its name.
3.  Update the name and ID of the field before saving.
4.  Once the field has been updated, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.
