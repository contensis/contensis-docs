Once created, content types will always have one of the following workflow states: *Draft*, *Awaiting publish* or *Published*.

## Draft

When a content type is created it will be in the *Draft* state until it has been published for the first time and will be highlighted in blue.

Another indication that the item is in draft is that it has no major version in its version number, for example *0.6*.

## Awaiting publish

When a content type has been published at least once, and had further changes saved to it, the content type will be *Awaiting publish* until it is published. It's effectively published and has a new draft state. Content types that are *Awaiting publish* will be highlighted in yellow.

Another indication that the item is *Awaiting publish* is that it will have major and minor version numbers, for example *1.6*.

## Published

When a content type is published and has had no further changes made to it, the content type status will be *Published* and the highlight will be green.

Another indication that the item is in the *Published* state is that it only has a major number in its version number, for example *2.0*.
