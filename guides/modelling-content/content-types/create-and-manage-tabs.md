You can use tabs to organise and group different categories of content in your content type. This makes it easier for your authors to populate and manage the content when using the entry editor.

## Add a tab to a content type

Every content type starts with a single tab called *Main*. Follow these steps to add additional tabs to your content type:

1.  With a content type opened for editing, press the **+** button from the tab bar. An *Add new tab* window will be displayed.
2.  Enter the name of your new tab and press **Add tab**. The tab will be created and you'll be taken to the empty tab.
3.  Add any fields to the tab and press **Save** and **Publish**.

**Note:** If you leave a tab empty, the tab will not be displayed when creating an entry.

## Add a tab description

You can add a short description to a tab that will be displayed in the entry editor. You can use this description to help your authors understand the intended purpose of the fields in the tab. To add a tab description:

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the tab. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Properties** from the menu. An *Edit tab* window will be displayed.
3.  Add a description for your authors and press **Update.**
4.  Once the tab has been updated, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

## Rename a tab

You can change the name of any tab once it has been created. To rename a tab:

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the tab. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Properties** from the menu. An *Edit tab* window will be displayed.
3.  Enter the new name for the tab and press **Update**. The tab will be updated and the window will close.
4.  Once the tab has been deleted, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

## Deleting tabs

If you no longer require a tab, it's possible to delete it in two different ways depending on whether it has fields or is empty.

### Delete a tab with fields

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the tab. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete** from the menu. A *Delete tab* confirmation window will be displayed, asking where you'd like to move the fields from the tab.
3.  Select another tab from the dropdown menu.
4.  Confirm the deletion by pressing **Delete tab and move fields**. The fields will be moved and the tab will be deleted.
5.  Once the tab has been deleted, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

### Delete an empty tab

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the tab. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete** from the menu. The tab will be deleted without any confirmation.
3.  Once the tab has been deleted, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

## Move a tab

You can reorder the tabs in the tab bar to provide a more logical content creation process for your authors. This can be achieved by following these steps:

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the tab. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  **Move left/right** will change the position of the tab by one place.
3.  **Move to the beginning/end** will move the tab to either end of the tab bar.
4.  Once the tab has been moved, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.

## Move a field between tabs

As you add tabs to your content type, you may find yourself needing to move fields between tabs. You can do this using drag and drop or by using the actions menu on a field.

### Drag and dropping fields between tabs.

1.  Press and drag the field you want to move to the tab you want to relocate it to in the tab bar.
2.  Drop the field on to the tab where you want to move it. An indicator will highlight where the field will be dropped.
3.  A notification will be displayed confirming that the field has been moved to its new location.
4.  Once the field has been moved, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.

### Move a field using the field actions menu

1.  With the field in the content type selected, press on the more actions button to open the menu.
2.  Select the **Move to tab** option. A submenu of available tabs will be displayed.
3.  Press on the name of the tab that you want to move the field to.
4.  A notification will be displayed confirming that the field has been moved to its new location.
5.  Once the field has been moved, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.
