All changes to a content type are recorded in a version history. The version number will reflect the workflow state that the content type is in. When a content type is first created its version number will be 0.1.

## Saving a content type

Each time a change is made to a content type and saved, the minor version number is incremented and the changes are recorded in a version history.

## Publishing a content type

When a content type is ready for publishing, pressing **Publish** in the *Content type builder* will change the major version number.
