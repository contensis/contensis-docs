If you have existing entries that you'd like to add to an area of your site, you can assign multiple entries to a section within the Site View screen. This is great if you want to add news, events, or blogs to an area of your site in bulk. You'll need to be a member of a role with Create node and [Manage entries permission](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/site-view/site-view-permissions) for the required content type to add entries to a site section.

1.  Select **Site View** in the sidebar to manage your site structure and content.
2.  With *Site View* open, use the tree to navigate to the node in your site where you'd like to add entries.
3.  Right-click or select the **Actions** option – indicated by the triple dot icon – to open the node context menu.
4.  Select **Add existing entries** from the menu that is displayed. A window will be displayed.
5.  You can now search for the entries you are looking for by entering a keyword or filtering to a particular content type.
6.  Select the entries you want to add from the list. A green active state and a tick above the entry icon will indicate your selection.
7.  With your selection made, press **Attach entries**. The entries will be added to the section and displayed in the listing.
