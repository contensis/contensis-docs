If you regularly manage content for your website, then the natural way to find your content is to locate it through your site navigation at a specific URL. Site View gives you a place to do that.

Access to the Site View tree is determined by being part of a role with Site View permission. Usually, editing entries would require entry permission for the content type your want to update as well as [Update node permission](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/site-view/site-view-permissions) in order to update the display name or URL slug.

1.  Select **Site View** from the sidebar to manage your site structure and content.
2.  With *Site View* open, use the tree to navigate to the area in your site that you'd like to update.
3.  Select a node in the tree with an entry attached. A page icon indicates this. The entry will open for editing. The interface will be familiar if you manage entries through the entry listing.
4.  Make your edits to the entry and press **Save** and **Submit** to send your content for approval, or **Publish** if the workflow allows you to publish the changes to the entry.

If you select a parent node/folder in the tree with an entry attached, for example,/about-us/, the entry editor will not be automatically displayed. To edit these entries, use the action context menu, which displays an Open entry option.

## Read-only view

If you don't have permission to edit a particular set of entries, the entry editor will be displayed in a read-only view and you will be unable to make changes to the entry.

## Empty nodes

In the event you select an empty node in the tree, you will be presented with a message telling you there is no entry attached to the node.
