If you are using Site View to power the navigation menus in your site, you may want to exclude a node from appearing in a menu. You'll need to be a role member with [Update node permission](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/site-view/site-view-permissions) for the location where you want to manage your menu.

1.  With Site View open, use the tree to navigate to the node you want to update.
2.  Right-click or select the **Action** button indicated by the triple dot icon, to open the node context menu.
3.  Select **Node properties** from the menu, and the node properties panel will be displayed.
4.  Turn the **Include in menu** toggle off and press **Update.**
5.  The changes to the node will be immediately available.
