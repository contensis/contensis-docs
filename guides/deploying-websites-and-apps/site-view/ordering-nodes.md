You can change the order of the nodes in your site from the Site View listing. This allows you to change the display order of the items on your site. This order can be used by navigation menus and listings built using the Delivery API.

You'll need to be part of a role with [Manage child order permission](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/site-view/site-view-permissions) for nodes for the site section you want to order, alternatively, if you are a member of the *Site View Administrators* security group, you can carry out this action.

## Change the order using drag and drop

The most common way to reorder the items in the listing is to use drag and drop.

1.  Select the **Actions** option from a parent node in the navigation tree, indicated by the triple dot icon.
2.  Press **Reorder** from the context menu that's displayed. The [Site View listing](/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/site-view/an-overview-of-the-site-view-interface) will switch into reorder mode.
3.  Select and begin to drag the items you want to reorder. A dashed green border will be displayed where the item can be dropped.
4.  Drop the item at its new location.
5.  Press **Apply** to save the new order.

If you attempt to navigate away without applying your changes to the order, you'll be prompted to save or discard any changes.

## Move items using context menu

Moving individual items to the top and bottom of a listing is possible using the reorder context menu.

1.  Select the **Actions** option from a parent node in the navigation tree, indicated by the triple dot icon.
2.  Press **Reorder** from the context menu that's displayed. The Site View listing will switch into reorder mode.
3.  Right-click on an item in the list, and a context menu will be displayed. Use the *Move to top* and *Move to bottom* options to move the item to the top or bottom of the list. Alternatively, you can move items up/down individually in the list.
4.  Press **Apply** to save the new order.

## Setting order to alphabetical

You can set the order of items in the listing alphabetically.

1.  Select the **Actions** option from a parent node in the navigation tree, indicated by the triple dot icon.
2.  Press **Reorder** from the context menu that's displayed. The Site View listing will switch into reorder mode.
3.  Change the order dropdown from **Custom** to **Alphabetical**.
4.  Press **Apply** to save the new order.
