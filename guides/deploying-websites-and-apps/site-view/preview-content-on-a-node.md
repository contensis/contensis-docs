If you want to gain an understanding of the render of your content from its position within your Site View tree, you can do this directly from the node itself by previewing that entry.

1.  Select **Site View** from the sidebar to manage your site structure and content.
2.  With *Site View* open, use the tree to navigate to the node in your site that you'd like to preview the content of. An entry must be attached to the node.
3.  Right-click or select the **Actions** option, indicated by the triple dot icon, to open the node context menu.
4.  Select **Preview** from the menu that is displayed, and you'll be taken to the preview URL for your site.
5.  In this new tab, you can use the [preview toolbar](/help-and-docs/user-guides/deployment/blocks/preview-a-block) to serve different blocks, block versions and content changes.
