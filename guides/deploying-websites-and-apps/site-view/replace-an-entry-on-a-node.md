If you want to replace an entry attached to a particular URL, you can replace the entry on a node within the Site View screen. You'll need to be a part of a role with [Manage entries permission](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/site-view/site-view-permissions) for the content type you want to replace on the selected node or be a *Site View Administrators'* security group member.

1.  Select **Site View** from the sidebar to manage your site structure and content.
2.  With *Site View* open, use the tree to navigate to the node in your site to which you'd like to replace the entry.
3.  Right-click or select the **Actions** option, indicated by the triple dot icon, to open the node context menu.
4.  Select **Replace entry** from the menu that is displayed. A window will be displayed.
5.  You can now search for the entry you are looking for by entering a keyword and filtering to a particular content type.
6.  Select an entry from the search results by pressing the entry in the list. A green active state and a tick above the entry icon will indicate your selection.
7.  With your selection made, press **Replace entry**. The entry will immediately replace the existing one and be available at the URL.
