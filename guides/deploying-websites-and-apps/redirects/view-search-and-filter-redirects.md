You can view, search, and filter existing redirects in Contensis.

To view redirects, you’ll need to be a System Administrator or a member of a role with `View` permissions.

Go to **Settings** in the sidebar and select **Redirects** from the menu.

If your project has many redirects, you may find it easier to use the filter panel to narrow down the number of redirects displayed. The filter acts as a faceted search, building a search query based on your selected filters.

## Search by keyboard

If you are looking for a specific redirect, you can use the keyword search box to locate it by the `source (from)` and `destination (to)` fields. To begin searching, type your keyword into the search box, and your results will update in the listing.

The search query also considers applied filters, such as *HTTP status code* or *Match type*.

## Filter by HTTP status code

The HTTP status code represents the redirect type. You can filter the results displayed by a HTTP status code:

## Filter by Match type

Sometimes you’ll want to locate redirects of a particular match type. Contensis supports the following match types:

-   **Exact**: A redirect that matches the entire string
-   **Starts with**: a redirect that starts with a specific value
-   **Regular expression**: String matching using a PCRE expression.
