If you no longer require a redirect, you can delete it from the listing.

To delete a redirect, you’ll need to be a member of a role with the redirect `Delete` permission.

1.  From the *Redirect listing* screen, locate the redirect you want to delete and press the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon. A drop down menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete** from the menu. A confirmation window will be displayed.
3.  Press **Delete** to confirm the deletion. The redirect will be permanently deleted.

**Note**: When you delete a redirect, it may take up to 2 minutes to deploy the change to all load balancers.
