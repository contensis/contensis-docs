Releasing a Block marks the Block version as being available and ready for production use. This can be fully automated from your continuous integration build or actioned as a manual process.

Depending on your development process, a QA engineer or development team may mark a Block version as released, allowing a site owner to make the final decision as to when the Block is made live in production.

To manually release a Block version you'll need to be a member of a role with the `Release` permission.

1.  Select **Blocks** in the sidebar to open the *Blocks listing* screen.
2.  Press on the Block you want to view. The Blocks version listing will be displayed.
3.  Locate the Block version you want to release and open the actions menu by pressing the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple-dot icon.
4.  Select **Release** from the dropdown menu. A confirmation window will be displayed.
5.  Press **Release** to confirm you want to release this version of the Block.
