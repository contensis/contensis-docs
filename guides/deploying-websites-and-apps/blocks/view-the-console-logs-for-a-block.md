We provide access to the console output from the currently running Block and the previous Block if it was terminated for any reason.

To view the console logs of a Block, you will need to be a System Administrator or a member of a role with `View` permission for Blocks.

1.  Navigate to the Blocks by pressing the **Blocks** button in the sidebar.
2.  Locate the Block you are interested in and open it to view the *Block version* data grid.
3.  Identify the Block version you want to troubleshoot and open the actions menu by pressing the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon.
4.  Select **Console logs** from the menu.
5.  The console logs for the selected Block will be displayed.

## Data centre switching

When troubleshooting an issue in Blocks, you may discover that an error is reported only in one data centre, even though Blocks runs in several data centres at the same time. To access the logs from each data centre, use the Data Centre dropdown menu.

**Note:** If you want to view the logs of a previously terminated container, check the *Show previous terminated container logs checkbox* in the log viewer.
