Block versions allow you and your team to see how changes to your Block will affect your site without having to deploy your changes to production.

Once a Block has been pushed to Contensis, each Block push will create a new Block version.

The *Blocks version* screen provides a view of all changes made to a Block, who made them, and their commit details to provide more context.

From the *Blocks version* screen, you can preview a Block change, roll back to a previous Block or view the console logs for a Block.

1.  Select **Blocks** in the sidebar to open the Blocks listing screen.
2.  Press on the Block you want to view. The Blocks version listing will be displayed.
