Marking a Block version as broken prevents the Block from ever making it to production. If you find an underlying issue with a Block, you can easily mark it as broken by following these steps.

**Live Blocks**: If you notice your live Block is broken, you will need to roll back to a previous live version before marking the Block as broken.

You'll need to be a member of a role with the `Mark as broken` permission.

1.  Select **Blocks** in the sidebar to open the *Blocks* listing screen.
2.  Press on the Block you want to view, and the *Block version* listing will be displayed.
3.  Locate the Block version you want to mark as broken and open the actions menu by pressing the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon.
4.  Select **Mark as broken** from the dropdown menu. A confirmation window will be displayed.
5.  Press **Mark as broken** to confirm that the Block should be marked as broken.
