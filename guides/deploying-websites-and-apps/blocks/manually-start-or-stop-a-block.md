Multiple versions of a Block can be running at the same time. This is most commonly the latest Block, the most recently released Block, and the Block that is currently live. You can have up to three additional Blocks running alongside these, including Blocks that have been started manually or those used by feature branches.

If you need to review a previous Block version, you can start additional Blocks manually. You'll need to be a member of a role with `Start/stop` permission to start or stop Blocks manually.

## Start a Block

1.  From the *Block versions* listing, locate the Block that you want to start. The Block has to be in the `Stopped` state and can't be marked as broken.
2.  Open the actions menu by pressing the **Action** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon.
3.  Select **Start Block** from the dropdown menu. The Block will be started.

## Stop a Block

1.  From the *Block versions* listing, locate the Block that you want to stop. The Block has to be in the `Available` state and can't be the current live version.
2.  Open the actions menu by pressing the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon.
3.  Select **Stop Block** from the dropdown menu. The Block will be stopped.
