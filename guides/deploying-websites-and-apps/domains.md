A domain name is the URL or web address where visitors find your site.

By default, any site on Contensis is accessible from its Contensis subdomain, which has the form `[alias].contensis.com`.

Adding a custom domain allows you to make your site accessible at your own domain names, such as `www.yourdomain.com` or `docs.yourdomain.com`. All top-level domains are supported for your custom domain.

## Definitions

-   **Domain name** (or **domain** for short)**:** full name used to access a site. For example, `alias.contensis.com` or `www.yourdomain.com`
-   **Top-level domain:** last part of the domain name. For example, the `.com` part in `www.yourcustomdomain.com`.
-   **Apex domain** (also known as a root, bare, or naked domain)**:** the `yourdomain.com` part in `www.yourdomain.com`.
-   **Subdomain:** domain that is part of a larger domain; the only domain that is not also a subdomain is the apex domain. For example, `www.yourdomain.com` and `docs.yourdomain.com` are subdomains of `yourdomain.com`.
