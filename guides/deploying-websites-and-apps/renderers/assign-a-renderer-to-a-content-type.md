If you would like to render all entries of a particular type using a single Block, you can assign a renderer to a content type.

The process below outlines how to select a renderer to render all entries of a specific type.

## Setting a renderer for a content type

1.  Navigate to the *Renderers* listing screen by pressing **Settings** in the sidebar and selecting **Renderers** from the menu.
2.  From the *Renderers* listing, locate and open the renderer for editing.
3.  In the *Content types* area, press **Add Content type** and choose a content type or multiple content types that should use the renderer.
4.  Press **Publish** to confirm your changes. Your changes will be immediate, and any content of that type will now use the associated Block.
