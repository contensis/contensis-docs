There are two ways to create a renderer – manually within Contensis settings or automatically on the push of a new Block.

To create a renderer, you’ll need to be a System Administrator or be a member of a role with `Create` permission for Renderers.

1.  Navigate to Renderers by pressing the **Settings** button in the sidebar and going to **Renderers** from the menu.
2.  Select **New renderer** from the toolbar. The *Renderer editor* will open.
3.  Give your renderer a name and an optional description – these will help you identify the renderer in Contensis. The renderer ID will be generated automatically.
4.  Each renderer needs to be associated with a Block. Select a Block by pressing **Add Block** and selecting one from the *Block* modal.
5.  A renderer can be directly assigned to entries of specific [content types](/help-and-docs/user-guides/deployment/renderers/assign-a-renderer-to-a-content-type) or all content types. If required, choose the content types that should use this renderer.
6.  Press **Publish** to save and your changes and make the renderer available.

**Note:** Only a single renderer can be assigned to all content types.
