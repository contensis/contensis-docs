You can view the renderers for your project by navigating to the *Renderers listing screen*. Access to this screen is restricted to system administrators or users who are members of a role with Renderer permissions.

## Renderer listing screen

1.  Navigate to Renderers by pressing **Settings** in the sidebar and selecting **Renderers** from the menu.
2.  A list of the renderers used in your project will be displayed.

## Filter renderers

If you use a lot of renderers in your project, then you may find it easier to search using the filter bar.

-   Type a word in the filter bar to narrow down the renderers displayed.
