If you no longer require a particular renderer, you can delete it from the renderer listing.

**Warning:** Deleting a renderer is irreversible and has the potential to break your site or service. Only do this if you are confident that the Site View nodes or content types using this renderer are being served by another Block or are no longer required.

To delete a renderer, you'll need to be a member of a role with renderer delete permission.

1.  From the *Renderer* listing screen, locate the renderer you want to delete and press the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon. A drop-down menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete** from the menu. A type to confirm window will be displayed.
3.  To confirm the deletion, you must type the name of the renderer in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
4.  Press **Delete**. The renderer will be permanently deleted, and the content will no longer be served from the endpoint.
