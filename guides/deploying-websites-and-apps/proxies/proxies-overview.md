Setting up a reverse proxy allows an organisation to direct its site visitors to one or more website instances while making them appear as though they're on the same domain as another existing website.

Let's say you have an existing website, such as www.website.com, that is **not** hosted on Contensis. Meanwhile, you've built a new section of your site, www.website.com/new-section, which **is** hosted on Contensis.

By creating a reverse proxy from Contensis to www.website.com, the new section would appear to be hosted from the same server as the website when it's actually coming from your Contensis environment.

This provides flexibility when you are setting up Contensis alongside an existing site or application and allows you to build one or more new site sections without a considerable migration.
