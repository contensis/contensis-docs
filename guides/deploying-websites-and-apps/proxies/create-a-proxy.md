There are two ways to create a proxy – within Contensis or by using the Management API. This guide will take you through setting one up in Contensis.

To create a proxy, you’ll need to be a System Administrator or be a member of a role with proxy permissions.

1.  Navigate to the *Proxies* screen by pressing **Settings** in the sidebar and selecting **Proxies** from the menu.
2.  Select **New proxy** from the toolbar. The proxy editor will open.
3.  You'll need to give your proxy a name and an optional description. These will help you identify the proxy in Contensis.
4.  A proxy must contain a single endpoint. If you serve multilingual content, you can add additional endpoints specific to the languages you need.
5.  Press **Save**, followed by **Publish**, to create your new proxy.
