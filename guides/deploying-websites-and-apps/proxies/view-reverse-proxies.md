Reverse proxies in Contensis are managed on a project basis. You'll need to be a System Administrator or a member of a role with [Proxy permissions](/help-and-docs/user-guides/deployment/proxies/proxy-permissions).

1.  Navigate to the *Proxies* screen by pressing **Settings** in the sidebar and selecting **Proxies** from the menu.
2.  A list of proxies for your project will be displayed.
