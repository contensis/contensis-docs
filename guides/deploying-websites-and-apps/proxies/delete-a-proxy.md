If you no longer require a particular proxy, you can delete it from the listing.

To delete a proxy, you'll need to be a member of a role with proxy delete permission.

1.  From the *Proxy* listing screen, locate the proxy you want to delete and press the **Actions** button indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete** from the menu. A type-to-confirm window will be displayed.
3.  To confirm the deletion, you must type the proxy name in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
4.  Press **Delete**. The proxy will be permanently deleted, and the content will no longer be served from the endpoint.
