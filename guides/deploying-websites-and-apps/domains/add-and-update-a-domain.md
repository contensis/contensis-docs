To add or update a domain, you’ll need to be a System Administrator.

## Add a new custom domain

-   Navigate to the Domain listing screen by pressing **Settings** in the sidebar and selecting **Domains** from the menu.
-   Select **New domain** from the toolbar. The *Add a domain* window will open.

When a domain is added we carry out a DNS verification to validate if you have pointed your DNS to Contensis. If you've not done this then you will see a failed DNS status for the newly added domain.
