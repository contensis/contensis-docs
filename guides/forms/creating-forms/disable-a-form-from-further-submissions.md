Disabling a form allows you to temporarily make it inaccessible without deleting it. This can be useful for recurring forms or surveys that you plan to use again in the future.

Follow these steps to disable your form or survey and re-enable it when needed.

1.  With a form opened for editing, select the **Form settings** button from the forms toolbar.
2.  Locate the *Auto close form* section and press the **Disable form** toggle to turn off the form.
3.  A form closure message box is displayed. Use this text area to inform your users that the form is now closed, for example, "The staff survey is now closed, thank you for your interest."
4.  **Save** and **Publish** the form changes.
