You can use pages to organise and group form fields into logical multi-page forms. This simplifies complex forms for your visitors and leads to better form completion.

## Add a page to a form

Every form starts with a single page called *Main*. Follow these steps to add additional pages to your form:

1.  With a form opened for editing, press the **\+ New page** button from the tab bar. An *Add page* window will be displayed.
2.  Enter the name of your new page and press **Add page**. The page will be created and you'll be taken to to it ready to add fields.
3.  Add any fields to the page and press **Save** and **Publish**.

## Add a page description

You can add a short description to a page that will be displayed in the rendered form. You can use this description to help your visitors understand the intended purpose of the fields in the page. To add a page description:

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the page in the tab bar. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Page properties** from the menu. An *Edit page* window will be displayed.
3.  Add a description for your visitors and press **Update.**
4.  Once the page has been updated, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

## Rename a page

You can change the name of any page once it has been created. To rename a page:

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the page in the tab bar. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Page properties** from the menu. An *Edit page* window will be displayed.
3.  Enter the new name for the page and press **Update**. The page will be updated and the window will close.
4.  Once the page has been updated, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

## Deleting pages

If you no longer require a page, it's possible to delete it in two different ways, depending on whether it has fields or is empty.

### Delete a page with fields

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the page. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete page** from the menu. A *Delete tab* confirmation window will be displayed, asking where you'd like to move the fields from the tab.
3.  Select another page from the dropdown menu.
4.  Confirm the deletion by pressing **Delete page and move fields**. The fields will be moved and the page will be deleted.
5.  Once the page has been deleted, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

### Delete an empty page

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the tab. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Select **Delete** from the menu. The page will be deleted without any confirmation.
3.  Once the page has been deleted, **Save** your changes and press **Publish**.

## Move a page

You can reorder the pages in the tab bar to change the flow of your form. This can be achieved by following these steps:

1.  Press the dropdown arrow next to the page in the tab bar. The actions menu will be displayed.
2.  Pressing **Move left/right** will change the position of the page by one place.
3.  Pressing **Move to the beginning/end** will move the page to either end of the tab bar.
4.  Once the page has been moved, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.

## Move a field between pages

As you add pages to your form, you may find yourself needing to move fields between pages. You can do this using drag and drop or by using the actions menu on a field.

### Drag and dropping fields between pages

1.  Press and drag the field you want to move to the page you want to relocate it to in the tab bar.
2.  Drop the field on to the page where you want to move it. An indicator will highlight where the field will be dropped.
3.  A notification will be displayed confirming that the field has been moved to its new location.
4.  Once the field has been moved, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.

### Move a field using the field actions menu

1.  With the field in the form selected, press on the more actions button to open the menu.
2.  Select the **Move to page** option. A submenu of available pages will be displayed.
3.  Press on the name of the page that you want to move the field to.
4.  A notification will be displayed confirming that the field has been moved to its new location.
5.  Once the field has been moved, **Save** and **Publish** your changes.
