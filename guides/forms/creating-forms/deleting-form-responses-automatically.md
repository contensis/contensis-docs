Keep personal data for the shortest necessary period. The auto-deletion feature helps you to manage and remove old form responses efficiently.

## Set the default form response retention period

Forms have a default form retention period, set within project settings. You'll need to be a System Administrator to change this setting.

1.  From the sidebar, press the **Settings** button.
2.  Select **Forms** from the tab bar.
3.  Find the *Automatically delete form responses* section. Change the default to a period you are happy with for this project, for example 30 days.
4.  **Save** your changes to the project.
5.  Any new form created will use this project setting.

## Set a custom retention period on a form

Each form can have its own retention period set, allowing different forms to retain their form responses for a longer or shorter period of time.

### Set a custom number of days

1.  With a form open for editing, select **Form settings** in the forms toolbar.
2.  Local the *Automatically delete form responses* section.
3.  Set a custom period for the form. Alternatively, reset the form to use the project default.
4.  **Save** and **Publish** your changes to the form.

## Disable auto-deletion of form responses

If you have a form where you do not want form responses to be deleted automatically, you can disable the automatic deletion.

1.  With a form opened for editing, select **Form settings** in the forms toolbar.
2.  Locate the *Automatically delete form responses* section.
3.  Turn off the toggle to disable automatic deletion.
4.  **Save** and **Publish** your changes to the form.
