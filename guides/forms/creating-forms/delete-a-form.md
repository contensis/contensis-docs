Deleting a form will remove the form and all of its responses. You'll need to be a member of a role with form Delete permission to delete the form and its responses.

1.  Open the form you want to delete by selecting it in the *Form listing* screen.
2.  When the *Form builder* opens, press the **Actions** button from the top toolbar.
3.  Press **Delete** from the menu. A *Delete form and responses* confirmation window will appear.
4.  To confirm deletion you will need to type the form name in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
5.  Press **I understand, delete the form and its responses**. The form and its responses will be permanently removed from your project.
