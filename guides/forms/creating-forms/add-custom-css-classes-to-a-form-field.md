Including custom CSS classes on form fields allows developers to add additional CSS hooks to easily style form fields to match your design system.

## Setting custom CSS classes

1.  With a form opened for editing, select the field that you want to add a custom CSS class to.
2.  From the *Advanced* panel, locate the *CSS Class* property.
3.  Enter the CSS classes you want added to the form field, for example star-rating.
4.  Press **Save** and preview the changes to your form, and **Publish** when you are happy.

## Tips

-   You dont need to add a period (.) before the class name
-   Multiple classes can be added by seperating each class name with a space.
-   Refer to our [sample CSS file](https://github.com/contensis/contensis-forms/blob/main/packages/react/src/themes/contensis.css) in the forms render package to see a comprehensive list of classes already in use.
