Prevent spam and bot submissions on your forms by adding Google reCAPTCHA v3. This ensures that the information you collect is authentic and that your form submissions come from real people.

## What is reCAPTCHA v3?

reCAPTCHA v3 is a Google service designed to protect websites from spam and abuse without interrupting users. Unlike traditional CAPTCHA tests, reCAPTCHA v3 runs in the background and assigns a risk score based on user behavior to determine whether the user is human.

## How does it work?

reCAPTCHA v3 works by analyzing user interactions on your site and providing a risk score that indicates the likelihood of the user being a bot. Based on this score, you can decide how to handle form submissions. This approach allows for seamless user experience without the need for users to solve puzzles or identify objects.

## How to enable reCAPTCHA v3 protection on your forms

1.  Create a new form or open an existing one from the *Forms listing* screen, accessed from the sidebar.
2.  Go to form settings by selecting the **Form settings** button, as represented by a cog icon, from the form toolbar.
3.  Scroll down to the *Anti-spam protection* section and toggle on **Enable Google reCAPTCHA**.
4.  **Save** and **Publish** your changes.
