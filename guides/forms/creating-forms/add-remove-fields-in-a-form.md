A form is made up of a set of fields or a combination of pages and fields. Each field allows you to capture different types of content from a visitor.

## Add a field

With a form open for editing:

1.  Press on a **form field** button in the toolbox for the field that you want to add to your form. Alternatively, use drag and drop to add your field.
2.  The field you've added will be active and indicated by a green border.

### Give your form a label

The settings for a field will be displayed in the right-hand panel when the field is active.

Give the field a label that clearly communicates what information you want a resonder to enter. You can use a simple term such as *Full name*, or use a conversational style, such as *What is your full name?*

### Response column name

The field label is also used to generate the name of the column that will be displayed in your form response listing and exports. The column name is also used to create a sanitised field ID that a developer can use with the API.

## Remove a field

If you no longer require a field within a form, it can be removed in the following way:

1.  With the form opened for editing, locate the field that you want to remove.
2.  Select the more actions button for the field, indicated by the triple dot icon.
3.  Press **Remove field** from the menu to remove it from the form. A *Delete field* confirmation screen will be displayed.
4.  Press **Delete**, then **Save**, followed by **Publish** to confirm your changes.
