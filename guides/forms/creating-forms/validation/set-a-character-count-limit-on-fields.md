There are times where the content you want to capture in a form needs to meet a character count limit. Character count validation can be applied to Short and Long text fields and is easy to set up in the forms builder.

## How to set the validation

With a form open for editing:

1.  Select the field you want to set a character count rule for and pick the **Validation** tab from the *Field settings* panel.
2.  Choose one of the following options from the *Number of characters* dropdown:

**Between** allows you to set the minimum and maximum values for an expected character range.

For example, *Requires between 200 - 300 characters*

**Minimum of** allows you to set an expected minimum value that needs to be met.

For example, *Requires a minimum of 200 characters*

**Maximum of** allows you to set the maximum number of characters that can be entered.

For example, *Requires a maximum of 200 characters*

3.  You can add an alternative validation message using the *Custom validation message* text box. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when published.
