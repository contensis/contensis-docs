The number validation checks the values of a field are within a specified range. You can define a range by specifying the *minimum* and the *maximum* values. Alternatively, you can specify only *minimum* or *maximum* value to set a limit on the minimum or maximum allowed value.

## How to set the validation

With a form open for editing:

1.  Select the number or decimal field you want to apply a validation rule to and select the **Validation** tab from the *Field settings panel*.
2.  Set a value for the minimum, maximum, or both fields to set a range of values.
    
    -   **Minimum** allows you to set an expected minimum value that needs to be met. For example, *Requires a minimum value of 10.*
    -   **Maximum** allows you to set the maximum value that can be set in the field. For example, *Requires a maximum value of 100.*
    -   **Minimum and maximum** allows you to define a range of values that can be set in the field. For example, *Requires a value between 10-100.* The minimum and maximum values are also included in the range.
    

You can add an alternative validation message by entering it in the custom validation message text box for each value. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when submitting the form.
