When you want to present a question with a variety of answers and require people to select only one option, a single choice or dropdown field is ideal. Single choice questions are great for collecting survey feedback, ratings, quizzes and tests.

## Add a single choice field

-   With a form opened for editing, select the **Single choice** option from the form fields list to add it to your form.
-   From the *Settings* panel, give the field a *Label*. For example, *What is your favourite colour?*
-   Update the *Response column name* to Favourite color.
-   You can now add the values for the question.

## Adding labels and values

-   Press the **Add labels and values** button in the *Settings* panel. A window will be displayed.
-   Enter a list of values by populating the label field. The value field is automatically generated for you. You can update the value field if needed.
-   Add additional labels and values by pressing the **\+ Add** button.
-   Save the list values by pressing **Confirm list values.**

## Remove labels and values

To remove labels and values, simply press the **Remove** button next to each list item. The label and value will be removed from the list.

## Reordering values

If you need to reorder the values that are displayed in the form, use the drag and drop handles on each list item to reorder them.
