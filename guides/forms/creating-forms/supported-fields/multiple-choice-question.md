-   You can now add the values for the question.

## Adding labels and values

-   Press the **Add labels and values** button in the *Settings* panel. A window will be displayed.
-   Enter a list of values by populating the label field. The value field is automatically generated for you. You can update the value field if needed.
-   Add additional labels and values by pressing the **\+ Add** button.
-   Save the list values by pressing **Confirm list values.**
