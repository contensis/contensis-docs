Use validation to ensure your forms collect complete, well-formatted, and high-quality data. Contensis provides several built-in validation methods to help you control input formats, set limits, and collect required information.

[Make a question required  
](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/guides/forms/creating-forms/validation/make-your-questions-required)  
Mark important fields as required to ensure you capture the data you need, while allowing respondents to skip less critical questions to increase your response rates.

Use the *Matches pattern* option to validate field input against a regular expression. Contensis includes common predefined patterns, or you can add your own custom regex.

[Set a character count limit on fields  
](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/guides/forms/creating-forms/validation/set-a-character-count-limit-on-fields)  
Control the length of responses by setting a minimum or maximum character limit, or by specifying an expected range. Character count validation can be applied to Short and Long text fields.

Number validation works like character limits, but for numeric values. You can set a minimum, maximum, or both to restrict the range of valid numbers. This works in both Number and Decimal fields.
