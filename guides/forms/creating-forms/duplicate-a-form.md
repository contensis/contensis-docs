If you need to create a form similar to an existing one, you can duplicate a form from the form builder. You'll need to be a member of a role with form `Create` permission to do this.

1.  Open the form you want to copy by selecting it in the *Forms listing screen*.
2.  When the form builder opens, press the **Action** button from the form toolbar.
3.  Press **Duplicate form** from the menu.
4.  The form will be duplicated and opened for editing. The new form will have '- copy' appended to its name.
5.  Update the form name and any necessary settings.
6.  Edit and update your form by adding or removing fields.
