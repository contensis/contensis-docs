You can enable or disable the autosave feature that stores your respondents’ answers in their web browser before they submit your form. This allows respondents to close your form and return later to complete and submit it.

To disable this feature – for privacy reasons, for example – you can toggle a switch in your form settings.

## How to enable or disable autosave progress

1.  Access the forms listing screen from the sidebar and create a new form or open an existing one.
2.  With the form opened for editing, select **Form settings** from the toolbar, as indicated by the cog icon.
3.  Scroll down to *Auto save progress* and toggle the **Enable auto save** switch on or off.
4.  **Save** and **Publish** your changes.

This feature is set individually for each form, allowing you to control the autosave progress for each one. By default, the autosave progress switch is turned off.
