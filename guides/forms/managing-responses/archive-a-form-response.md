Deleting a response in Contensis moves it to the recycle bin, from where it will automatically be deleted based on the retention period set on the form. Archiving a response, on the other hand, moves the entry to Archive, where it will be stored indefinitely.

## Archive a response from the response viewer

1.  With the response listing open, select a response and open it.
2.  The response will be displayed in the viewer. Press the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will be displayed.
3.  Press the **Archive** option in the menu. An *Archive confirmation* window will be displayed.
4.  Confirm the archiving of the response by pressing the **Archive** button. The response will be moved to the archive.
