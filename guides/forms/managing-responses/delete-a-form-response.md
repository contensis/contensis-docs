If you have Delete permission, you can delete a form response from either the response listing screen or the response viewer. Deleting a response moves it to the recycle bin, where it will stay for the retention period specified for the form.

## Delete a response from the response viewer

1.  With the response listing opened for your form, select a response and open it.
2.  The response will be displayed. Press the **Actions** button, as indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will be displayed.
3.  Press the **Delete** option in the menu. A *Delete confirmation* window will be displayed.
4.  Confirm the deletion of the response by pressing the **Delete** button. The response will be moved to the recycle bin.

## Delete an entry from the listing

1.  Locate the response you want to delete by scrolling through the listing or using the search.

3.  Press **Delete** from the menu. A *Delete confirmation* window will be displayed.
4.  Confirm the deletion of the response by pressing the **Delete** button. The response will be moved to the recycle bin.
