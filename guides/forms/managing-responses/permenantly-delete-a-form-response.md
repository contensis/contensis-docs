Once a form response has been deleted, it is kept in the form’s recycle bin for the retention period set in form settings before it is permanently deleted. In the event that you would like to permanently delete an response before this period is reached, you can choose to permanently delete the response manually.

You'll need to be a member of a role with the *Delete* permission for form responses to be able to see and permanently delete the response from the project.

1.  With the *Forms response listing* screen open, turn on the **Show deleted** toggle from the search panel.
2.  Previously deleted items are shown in the listing, and are indicated by a Recycle bin status.
3.  Locate the response you want to permanently delete in the listing.
4.  Press the **Actions** button for the response, as indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will be displayed.
5.  Select **Permanently delete** in the menu. A *Permanently delete confirmation* window will appear.
6.  Press the **Permanently delete** button to confirm the action. A notification will be displayed confirming the form response has been deleted.
