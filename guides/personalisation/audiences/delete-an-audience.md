Deleting an audience will permanently remove it from your system. You can only delete an audience if it is not in use. To delete an audience, you must be a member of a role with Delete permission for audiences.

Follow these steps to delete an audience:

1.  Open the audience listing screen and select the audience you want to delete.
2.  When the audience editor opens, select **Actions** in the top toolbar.
3.  From the menu, choose **Delete**. A confirmation window will appear.
4.  In the confirmation window, select **Delete this audience** to confirm.

Once deleted, the audience is removed permanently, and you’ll be returned to the audience listing screen.
