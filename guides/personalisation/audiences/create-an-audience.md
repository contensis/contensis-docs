To personalise content for specific site visitors, you’ll need to create an Audience. An Audience defines the characteristics that determine whether a visitor should see personalised content. You'll need to be part of a role with Create and Update permissions to create audiences.

Follow these steps to create an audience:

1.  To navigate to the audience screen, select **Personalisation** from the sidebar, then choose **Audiences** from the menu.
2.  Press **New audience** in the page header to create a new audience. The audience editor will open.
3.  -   **Name**: Give your audience a clear, descriptive name to help identify it when assigning content.
    -   **API ID**: This is used programmatically to reference the audience.
    -   **Description (optional)**: Add a description to further clarify the purpose of the audience.
    
    Provide the required details:
4.  Add one or more rules to define the audience membership. Rules can reference signals or other audience criteria that should be matched. You can configure whether all rules must be met or any rule can be met for a visitor to be part of the audience.
5.  Press **Save** to make your audience available for use in personalisation.
