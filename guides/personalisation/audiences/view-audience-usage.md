Audiences in Contensis are primarily used to deliver personalised content within entries. They can also be referenced by other audiences. To help you understand where a specific audience is used, you can view its usage through the Audience usage panel in the Audience editor.

## How to view audience usage

Follow these steps to see where an audience is used:

1.  Navigate to the Audiences screen. Select **Personalisation** from the sidebar, then choose **Audiences** from the menu.
2.  In the audience listing, select the audience you want to review.
3.  In the vertical navigation of the editor, click **Usage**. This opens the usage panel, which displays any related usage.

## What you’ll see

The usage panel lists:

-   **Entries** – All entries where the audience is assigned.
-   **Audiences** – Any other audiences that reference this audience.

You can navigate directly to any entry or audience by clicking it in the list.
