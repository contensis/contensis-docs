Deleting a signal will permanently remove it from your system. You can only delete a signal if it is not in use.

To delete a signal:

1.  Open the Signal listing screen and select the signal you want to delete.
2.  When the Signal editor opens, press the **Actions** button in the top toolbar.
3.  From the menu, select **Delete**. A *Delete signal?* confirmation window will appear.
4.  Press **Delete signal** to confirm. The signal will be deleted, and you’ll be returned to the Signal listing screen.
