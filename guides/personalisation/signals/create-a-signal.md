To personalise content for audiences, you’ll need to create a Signal that defines the personalisation characteristics. Creating Signals is restricted to users who have a role with Create and update permission.

Follow these steps to create a Signal:

1.  Navigate to the Signals screen. Select **Personalisation** from the sidebar, then choose **Signals** from the menu.
2.  Press **New signal** in the page header. The Signal editor will open.
3.  -   Name: Give your signal a clear, descriptive name to help identify it when assigning to audiences.
    -   API ID
    -   Description (optional): Add a description to further clarify the purpose of the signal.
    
    Provide the required details
4.  Set up rules and conditions:
    
    -   Add one or more rules. Each rule consists of one or more conditions.
    -   For each condition:
        
        -   Choose a supported signal attribute (e.g. Browser language, Page path, Session page views).
        -   Select an appropriate operator (e.g. equals, contains, greater than).
        -   Enter the value you want to match.
        
    
5.  Press **Save** to make your signal available for use in audiences.
