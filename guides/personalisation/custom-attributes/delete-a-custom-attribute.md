Deleting a custom attribute will permanently remove it from your system. You can only delete a custom attribute if it is not in use.

To delete a custom attribute:

1.  Open the Custom attribute listing screen and select the custom attribute you want to delete.
2.  When the Custom attribute editor opens, press the **Actions** button in the top toolbar.
3.  From the menu, select **Delete**. A *Delete custom attribute?* confirmation window will appear.
4.  Press **Delete custom attribute** to confirm. The custom attribute will be deleted, and you’ll be returned to the Custom attribute listing screen.
