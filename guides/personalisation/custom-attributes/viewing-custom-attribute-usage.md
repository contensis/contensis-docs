Custom attributes allow you to define signals that are specific to your organisation, site, or audience. This gives you greater flexibility and precision when targeting content for your visitors. Custom attributes are assigned to signals, and you can view where a custom attribute is used through the usage panel in the custom attribute editor.

## How to view custom attribute usage

Follow these steps to see where a custom attribute is used:

1.  Navigate to the Custom attributes screen. Select **Personalisation** from the sidebar, then choose **Custom attributes** from the menu.
2.  In the custom attribute listing, select the custom attribute you want to review.
3.  In the vertical navigation of the editor, click **Usage**. The usage panel will open, showing any related usage.

## What you’ll see

The usage panel lists:

-   Signals – All signals that reference the custom attribute.

You can navigate directly to any signal by selecting it in the list.
