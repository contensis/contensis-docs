Audiences are a key part of personalisation in Contensis. An audience is a group of visitors who share common characteristics, such as their location, device type, or how they have interacted with your site.

**Example:** you might create an audience for first-time visitors on mobile devices or returning users from Spain.

By defining audiences, you can tailor your site’s content, layout, or features to match the needs and interests of different groups. This helps engage visitors and encourage actions that support your goals, such as signing up, making a purchase, or exploring more content.

## How does Contensis define an audience?

An audience is made up of one or more conditions that determine whether a visitor belongs to that group. These conditions can be built from:

-   **Signals**, which are characteristics or behaviours captured from visitors, such as device type, location, or referrer.
-   **Other audiences**, which allow you to combine existing audiences to create more complex groupings.

## Example audiences

Here are some example audiences you might define:

### Local government

-   Residents of a specific council area (based on location signal).
-   Businesses accessing licensing or permit services (based on page visits or referrer).
-   Mobile users accessing waste collection or recycling pages.
-   Returning visitors who have interacted with online service forms.

### Higher education

-   Prospective undergraduate students from outside the UK.
-   Current students accessing the site from on-campus Wi-Fi.
-   Returning visitors who previously viewed accommodation or course pages.
-   Alumni visiting from specific regions for reunion or donation campaigns.

## How are audiences used for personalisation?

Once you have set up an audience, you can:

-   Target content by showing parts of a page for different audiences, using the audience picker field in your entries and components.
-   Preview personalisation by using the Contensis personalisation toolbar to see how your content will look to each audience before you publish.

## Summary

Audiences make it easy to deliver relevant content that increases engagement, improves user experience, and supports your business objectives.
