To view and publish changes to the personalisation manifest, you must be a member of a role with View and Publish permissions for manifests. To access the manifest screen, select **Personalisation** from the sidebar, then choose **Manifest** from the menu.

## Change log

The change log helps you track, review, and publish updates to your personalisation manifest. It gives you visibility of what has changed, who made the changes, and when. This supports accountability, improves transparency, and makes troubleshooting easier. You can compare versions, review detailed changes, and publish updates when you are ready.

### Recent changes

The recent changes section lists all updates made between the published version of the manifest and the latest version. It shows what was updated, who made the changes, and when. Each signal or audience appears with the action taken, who performed it, and the time of the change.

### Publish history

The publish history records all versions published to the personalisation manifest. It shows when each version was published, who published it, and how many audiences and signals were included at that point.

## Review and publish changes

### Compare the latest and published versions

The compare changes screen provides a detailed, side-by-side view of your manifest in JSON in a diff editor. It highlights the differences between the latest and published versions and allows you to navigate easily between each addition and removal.

This view is especially helpful for technical team members working on your front-end experience who need to understand exactly what has changed.

### Publish changes to the manifest

When you are happy with your updates, publish the manifest to apply your new personalisation logic to the live site. This ensures visitors see the latest experience.
