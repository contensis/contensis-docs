Inline entries allow you to create dynamic content within the flow of your writing. They are automatically updated in the Canvas whenever the entry is updated.

## Uses

-   Adding an abbreviation within your writing, with the definition specified in an abbreviation entry.
-   Organisation terms that are subject to change like a department name.
-   Inserting text snippets into your copy such as brand terms or copyright information, addresses, telephone numbers that would benefit being dynamically updated.
-   Creating a hyperlink to an entry if you are not using Site View to manage your routing.

## Add an inline entry

-   Insert an inline entry using the forward slash `/` command `/inline` and press `Enter`. An inline entry window will be displayed to select an entry allowed by the Canvas.
