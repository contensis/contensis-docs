Canvas at its core is a text editor, and it wouldn’t be a text editor without its core content blocks.

## Paragraphs

A paragraph is the most basic content block you can use in a canvas and is the only content block that can’t be disabled.

The canvas also supports a lead paragraph option to style the first paragraph of a field where needed.

-   Use the formatting toolbar to convert a paragraph to a lead paragraph.
-   Use the actions menu `Command+/` or `Control+/` to change the paragraph type.

## Headings

Using different sizes of headings throughout your writing gives your content more structure, context, and a sense of priority. Contensis supports six heading levels, however try to keep this number appropriate to your content.

All headings have [HTML anchor links](/help-and-docs/guides/authoring-and-managing-content/canvas-editor/links-and-anchors), which are links that you can use to point to a particular section of your documentation.

-   Use markdown to insert a heading of a specific size e.g. `# Heading level one ## Heading level two`.
-   Use markdown before an existing heading to convert to another heading level.
-   Insert a heading using the forward slash `/` command `/heading` and navigating through the levels and press `Enter`.
-   Use the formatting toolbar to convert a paragraph to a heading.

## Lists

We support unordered and ordered lists in Canvas, represented by bulleted and numbered lists.

### Bulleted lists

Unordered lists are great for making a series of points that do not necessarily need to be made in a particular order.

-   Use the markdown shortcuts `*`, `-` or `+` followed by a `Space`
-   Insert a list item using the forward slash `/` command `/bullet` and pressing `Enter`.
-   Convert a paragraph to a list item using the keyboard shortcut `Command+L` or `Control+L`

To create nested items, you can use `Tab` to indent and `Shift+Tab` to remove the indent.

### Numbered

Ordered or numbered lists help you prioritise items or create a list of steps.

-   Use the markdown shortcuts `1.` or `1)` followed by a `Space`
-   Insert a numbered list item using the forward slash `/` command `/number` and pressing `Enter`.
-   Convert a paragraph to a numbered list item using the keyboard shortcut `Command+Shift+L` or `Control+Shift+L`

To create nested items, you can use `Tab` to indent and `Shift+Tab` to remove the indent.

## Divider

If you want to create a visual divider in a piece of long form content, you can use the divider block.

-   Add a divider by typing `---`, `+++` or `___` followed by a space
-   Insert a divider using the forward slash `/` command `/divider` and pressing `Enter`.

## Quotes

Quotes are useful when you want to include something from another source.

-   Start a quote by typing `>` followed by pressing `Space` in an empty paragraph.
-   Insert a quote using the forward slash `/` command `/quote` and pressing `Enter`.
