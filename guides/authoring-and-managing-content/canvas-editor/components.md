Components offer the ability to add additional structured content to a Canvas that isn't possible from an existing content block. For example if you want to include a carousel, an accordion, or a promoted product slider in the middle of your content, you can easily add these using existing components from your content models.

The component will be displayed as a simple list card, leaving the rendering up to your front-end development team.

## Add a component to the canvas

Type `/component` and press `Enter`. A window will be displayed where you can choose the component you want to insert.

If you have restricted the components in you canvas configuration, then you can also type /{componentname} in the editor to directly insert a component by name, for example /accordion.

## Edit a component

-   With a component inserted in the Canvas, press the **Edit** button from the block toolbar. The component will open up for editing in the flyout editor.
-   With the component focused, press Enter and the component will open for editing.
-   Alternatively, double click the component to edit its content.

## Delete a component

-   If you no longer require the component in the Canvas, press the **Delete** button in the block toolbar.
-   Pressing Del or Backspace with the block focused will remove the component and its content from the Canvas.
-   You can also use the actions menu by pressing `Command/Control+/` and selecting delete from the menu.
