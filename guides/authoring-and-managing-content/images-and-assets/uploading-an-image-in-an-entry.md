When an image field is added to a content type and it's set to support uploads, an author with appropriate permission can upload an image to the entry rather than using an existing image from the image gallery.

## Asset upload permission

To upload images for use in an entry, authors need to belong to a role with permission to **Create** and **Update** assets. Without these permissions, authors will only be able to select from existing images in the asset library.

## Image metadata

When you upload an image, the upload modal allows you to set a variety of metadata to make your image more searchable and help save time for other authors who may use your image at a later date.

### Title

The title field helps identify the image in the media library. It's best to use descriptive, concise titles that clearly explain what the image contains.

### Alternative text

Alternative text (alt text) describes the image for users who cannot see it, including those using screen readers. Good alt text is concise but descriptive, quickly conveying the purpose and content of the image.

### Description (caption)

The description field allows you to provide additional context about the image that may not be obvious from the title alone. This information may be displayed as a caption in a page.

## Entry metadata

After adding an image to an entry, you can customise additional metadata that is specific to how the image is used within that particular entry.

### Alternative text

After you add an image to an entry, you can customise the alt text for each translation of your entry or in the event that cropping the image changes the meaning of the default alt text. This allows for context-specific descriptions that may differ from the general alt text stored with the image asset.

#### Reset alt text

If you want to reset the Alt text to use the original Alt text for the image then press the **Reset alt text** button.

### Caption

Often captions are used to provide additional context or information about an image as it appears in a specific entry. Captions can include details like:

-   The names of people shown in the image
-   The location where the photo was taken
-   The date or event associated with the image
-   Attribution or credit information
-   Explanatory text that helps connect the image to the surrounding content

## Optimising image metadata

Take time to complete all metadata fields when uploading images. Thorough metadata increases searchability in the asset gallery and improves accessibility for all users. Images with complete metadata are more likely to be reused appropriately across your content, saving time and maintaining consistency.
