This guide provides an overview of the various types of notifications you can expect, and explains how you can manage or turn off notifications according to your preferences.

## Entry workflow notifications

As an entry passes through workflow, authors or approvers of content governed by the roles they are members of will be sent email notifications. Each notification is explained below.

-   ⚠️ **When an entry is sent for approval** – Any user that can approve entries of a given content type will be notified by email, unless the author submitting the entry has selected a set of users or specific roles to be notified.
-   ❌ **When an entry is declined** – The author that sent the entry for approval will be notified that the entry was declined by the approver.
-   🎉 **When an entry is approved and published** – The author that submitted the entry for approval will be notified that the entry was approved and published.
-   ✅ **When an entry is approved and scheduled for publishing** – The author that submitted the entry for approval will be notified that the entry was approved and has been scheduled for publishing.

## Commenting notifications

Commenting on entries provides a way for teams to collaborate on content. Email notifications are sent under the following conditions.

-   **When you have been mentioned in a comment** – when someone @mentions you in a conversation, you’ll receive an email notification with the comment in the body of the email.
-   **When a conversation you are part of has been resolved** - If you have been engaged in a discussion on an entry you’ll be notified that the conversation has been marked as resolved.

## Content owner changes

When a content owner is updated or unassigned from an entry, both the new and previous owners are notified.

## Form response assignee

When a person is assigned or unassigned from a form response, both the new and previous assignees receive notifications.

## Turning off email notifications

Email notifications in Contensis primarily focus on events that require action. If you prefer to turn off notifications completely then this can be done in your user profile.

1.  Press on your avatar in the sidebar.
2.  Select **User profile** from the popup menu and your user profile will be displayed.
3.  Scroll down to *Email notifications* and turn the **Send notifications by email** toggle off, followed by pressing **Save**.
4.  Email notifications will no longer be sent.

### Notifications that override your preferences

There are some notifications that you will recieve regardless of your email notification preferences.

-   When you are added or removed as the content owner of an entry.
-   When you are assigned or unassigned as the person responsible for a form response.
-   When you are directly @mentioned in a comment.
-   When you are specifically chosen to be the approver of an entry.
