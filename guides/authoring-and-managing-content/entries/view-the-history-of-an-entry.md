All changes to an entry are recorded in version history. To view the history of an entry follow these steps:

1.  Press the **Entries** button in the sidebar to open the *Entries listing* screen.
2.  Press the entry title to open the entry. The *Entry editor* will be displayed.
3.  Press the **Actions** button (indicated by the triple dot icon). A dropdown menu will be displayed.
4.  Select **Version history** in the menu. The *version history* screen will slide into view.

## Comparing versions

The *version history* screen is split into three panels:

-   The *Compare version* panel shows the version of the entry that is currently selected from the *Versions* change list. When you select a change from the list in the *Version* panel, the *Compare version* panel will update, so you can compare the selected changed version with the version that you are currently editing.
-   The *Current version* panel shows the version of the entry that you are currently editing. Any fields that have been updated in a subsequent version will be highlighted in yellow
-   The *Versions* panel shows the version history of an entry as a list of changes that have been made over time.

### Only show updated fields

Pressing the **Only show updated fields** checkbox in the *Current version* panel will hide any unchanged fields and show only the changed fields between the *compare version* and the *current version*.

### Applying changes

If you want to reinstate content from an earlier version, select **Copy field** (indicated by an arrow icon) on the field that holds your preferred content.

Alternatively, use the **Copy all fields** button to update the current version with all the previous content. Press **Apply changes** to complete the action and return to the entry editor.
