If you find yourself producing entries that are very similar, you can create a copy of an existing entry from the listing screen or the entry editor. You'll need to be a member of a role with permission to create the type of entry you are attempting to copy.

## Copy an entry from the editor

1.  Press the **Entries** button in the sidebar to open the *Entries listing screen*.
2.  Locate the entry you want to edit by either scrolling through the listing or by using the search.
3.  Open the entry. The entry editor will be displayed. Press the **Actions** button indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will be displayed.
4.  Select **Copy** from the menu. The entry will be copied and opened for editing. The new entry will have ' *\- copy* ' appended to the title field.
5.  The new entry is open for editing without needing to repopulate all the fields.
