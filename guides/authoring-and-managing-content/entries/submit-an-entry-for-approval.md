When a content type is assigned to an approval workflow, any entry authored using that content type must be submitted for approval before it is published.

An entry that has been submitted for approval can be approved by any user with the correct permission. However, at the point of submitting the entry you can choose to notify all approvers, a list of users, or specific roles that have permission to approve the content.

## Send to all approvers

After creating an entry that is part of an approval workflow, pressing the **Send for approval** button in the toolbar will present you with the following window.

By default All approvers (determined by roles) will be notified that the entry needs approval. The number of people that will be notified is displayed.

Any message that is added will be included in the notification email.

## Send to a list of users or roles

When the entry you are working on needs to be reviewed by specific team members you can choose them from the list by entering their name or email address.

Alternatively if a group of approvers need to be notified and you know the role name, select a role or set of roles from the list.
