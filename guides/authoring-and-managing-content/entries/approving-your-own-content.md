Applying the principles of content governance in an organisation is essential to ensure every piece of content is of good quality and on-brand.

However, as an approver, you are likely to face situations where you need to approve content you’ve recently changed without bothering colleagues to approve it.

In this situation, you can approve and publish the content you’ve created or amended.

-   When you’ve finished making changes to your content, **Save** your changes.
-   Select **Approve and publish** or **Approve and schedule** from the toolbar.
-   Your content will be approved and published immediately or at the scheduled time.

All changes to content are recorded in version history and summarised in the entry activity panel.
