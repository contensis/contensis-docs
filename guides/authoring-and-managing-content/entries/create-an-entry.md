An *Entry* is a piece of content that has been created from a content type. You can create unlimited entries for a content type.

1.  Press the **Entries** button in the sidebar to open the *Entries* listing screen.
2.  Press the **New entry** button. A list of content types based on your permissions will be displayed.
3.  Select the content type from the list that you want to create a new entry from. You can use the filter bar to reduce the number of content types shown in the list. The *Entry editor* screen will be displayed.
4.  The fields in the *Entry editor* can now be populated. Press **Save** between any changes that have been made. The minor version will increment upon each save. Take a look at our [entry versioning](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/authoring/entries/entry-versioning) article for details of how entries are versioned.
5.  When you have finished creating your entry, you can either **Submit** your content for approval or **Publish** the content, depending on the workflow type assigned to the content type.
