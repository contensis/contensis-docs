Making content avaliable in other system can often require content to be saved as a CSV file. This is useful for doing further analysis, producing graphs, or for merging data from multiple data sources.

You can export a list of entries from the *Entry listing* or *Advanced search* screens in Contensis. The interface is limited to exporting 10,000 entries, so ideally your export would be based on a search that reduces the number of entries below this value.

### Export the current page

If you have a single page of entries you can quickly export them to CSV using the *Table options* menu in the page toolbar. To export the current page:

1.  Press the **Table options** cog in the page toolbar.
2.  Select **Export to CSV** from the dropdown menu.
3.  Your entries will be downloaded in the following format: export\_2024-06-13\_16-43-47.csv

### Export all entries

If your entries span multiple pages, the export to CSV option will present you with a window asking you if you want to download the current page or all responses. To export your entries:

1.  Press the **Table options** cog in the page toolbar.
2.  Select **Export to CSV** from the dropdown menu.
3.  From the window that is displayed, select from the *Current page* or *All entries* options.
4.  Your entries will be downloaded in the following format: export\_2024-06-13\_16-43-47.csv

## What data is exported?

The entry data that is exported is based on what you can see in the listing. So, if you have used managed columns to reorder column data, or have added or removed columns, then this is reflected in your export.

If you need to export data that can't be displayed in the listing, you can use the Contensis CLI to export this data.
