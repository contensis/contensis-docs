All changes to an entry are recorded in its [version history](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/authoring/entries/view-the-history-of-an-entry). The version number will depend on the workflow state that the entry is in. When an entry is first created its version is 0.1.

## Save an entry

Each time a change is made to an entry and saved, the minor version number is incremented and the changes are recorded in the entry activity panel.

## Publish an entry

When an entry is ready for publishing, pressing **Publish** in the entry editor will change the major version number.
