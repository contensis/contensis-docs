Once created, entries will always have one of the following workflow states: *Draft*, *Awaiting publish* or *Published*. If your license key supports the multilingual module, then the *Awaiting translation* and *Not yet translated* states will also be available.

## Draft

When an entry is created it will be in the *Draft* state until it has been published for the first time. It will be highlighted in blue.

Another indication that the item is in *Draft* is that it has no major version in its version number, for example *0.6*.

## Awaiting approval

When an entry is sent for approval in the approval workflow, it will be moved into the *Awaiting approval* workflow state until it is approved and subsequently published.

Another indication that the item is *Awaiting approval* is that it has major and minor numbers in its version number, for example *1.6*.

## Due to be published

An entry enters the *Due to be published* workflow state when it has a publish schedule set and has been approved in the approval workflow. If the entry is in the basic workflow, it will appear in the *Due to be published* workflow state once the schedule button is pressed in the editor toolbar.

## Published

An entry is published once approved in the approval workflow. In the basic workflow, an entry is published immediately after the publish button is pressed. A published entry is indicated in the entry listing by a tick icon in the published column.  
Once an entry is published, its workflow status is cleared until a change is made to the entry. Making a change moves the entry into the *Draft* workflow state.

Another indication that the item is *Published* is that it only has a major number in its version number, for example *2.0*.

## Never translated (licensed feature)

When a language variation exists and its content has not yet been created, the entry will have the *Never translated* state.

## Awaiting translation (licensed feature)

When a language variation has a published version and changes to the default language have been made, the entry will have the *Awaiting translation* state.
