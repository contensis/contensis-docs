If you've created or added a variety of views to your favourites over time, you can remove them from your list without deleting them permanently.

1.  With a My views panel displayed, locate a view you want to remove from your favourites and press the **Actions** button, indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will show.
2.  Select the **Remove from my views** from the menu.
3.  The view will be removed from the list, and a notification will be displayed confirming the removal.
