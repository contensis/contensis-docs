A private view allows you to save a commonly used search and column layout to be recalled later. Your private views can only be seen by you.

1.  Press the **Entries** button in the sidebar to open the *Entries listing* screen or the **Advanced search** button to open the ZenQL search.
2.  Use the search panel in the entries listing to filter content or build a ZenQL query in the advanced search to locate entries. Optionally, customise the columns displayed using [Manage columns](/help-and-docs/user-guides/authoring/entries/change-the-view-of-the-entry-listing).
3.  Select **Save view** from the toolbar. A window will show.
4.  Provide a name and optional description for your view and press **Save view**.
5.  A notification will be displayed confirming the creation of the view.
