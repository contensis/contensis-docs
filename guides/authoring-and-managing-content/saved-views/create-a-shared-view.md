A shared view makes your private view available to others in your project or team. You'll only be able to share a view if you are a member of a role with the `Share entry views` permission.

1.  Press the **Entries** button in the sidebar to open the *Entries listing* screen or the **Advanced search** button to open the ZenQL search.
2.  Use the search panel in the entries listing to filter content or build a ZenQL query in the advanced search to locate entries. Optionally, customise the columns displayed using [Manage columns](/help-and-docs/user-guides/authoring/entries/change-the-view-of-the-entry-listing).
3.  Select **Save view** from the toolbar. A window will show.
4.  Provide a name and optional description for your view and enable the **Set as shared view** toggle.
5.  Press **Save view** to save the new shared view.
6.  A notification will be displayed confirming the creation of the view.
