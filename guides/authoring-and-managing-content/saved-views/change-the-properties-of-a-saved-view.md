Suppose you want to update the name, description or sharing preferences of a view. Follow these steps to change the properties:

1.  With a view panel displayed in the *Entry listing* or *Advanced search* screen, locate the view you want to update and press the **Actions** button, indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will show.
2.  Select **Properties** from the menu. An *Update view?* window will appear.

### Name and description

Change the name or description of your view to quickly identify it in the listing.

**Tip:** You can use emojis 😀 in the name of your view to make it stand out from the others.

### Share a private view with others

To make the private view available to others, you can set the view to be shared. This requires you to be a member of a role with `Share views` permission.

1.  Enable the **Set as shared view** toggle and press **Update view**.
2.  A notification will be displayed confirming the update.
