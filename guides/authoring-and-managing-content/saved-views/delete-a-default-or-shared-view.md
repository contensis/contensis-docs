Default and shared views can be deleted through a centralised management screen in project settings.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar and select **Project views** from the menu. A list of shared and default views will be displayed.
2.  Locate a view you want to delete and press the **Actions** button indicated by the triple dot icon. A dropdown menu will show.
3.  Select **Delete** from the menu. A *Delete default/shared view?* confirmation window will appear.
4.  Confirm the deletion of the view by pressing the **Delete** button.
5.  Upon confirming the deletion a notification will be displayed, informing you that the delete action has been completed.

Be aware deleting a default or shared view will remove the view from the default views list and the My views (favourites) list for anyone who has favourited them.
