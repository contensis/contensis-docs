Your private and any shared or default views that have been created in a project can be added to the *My views (favourites)* list. This makes it easy to add views created by others in your team or organisation.

1.  With a *My views* panel displayed, press the + button. The *Add views* window will appear.
2.  By default, all views you don't currently have added to your favourites are displayed, along with any optional descriptions.
3.  You can filter the views displayed using the search and the View type dropdown.
4.  Select a view you want to add and press **Add to my views**.
5.  A notification will be displayed confirming the view has been added to your favourites.
