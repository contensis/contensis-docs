1.  Open an entry for editing or review.
2.  Select the **Comments** button in the editor toolbar. The comments panel will be displayed.
3.  Change the filter dropdown from *Active comments* to *Resolved conversations*.
4.  Locate the conversation you want to unresolve by selecting the field that contains the discussion you are interested in.
5.  Press the **Unresolve** button on the conversation. The conversation will become active, and you'll automatically navigate to the conversation, ready to reply.

**Note:** Only the creator or a System Administrator can unresolve a conversation.
