Once you add a comment to a conversation, you have two minutes to update it. A comment can only be updated by the user who posted it.

To update a comment:

1.  Open an entry for editing or review.
2.  Press the **View/Add comment** button on the field with the comment you want to update. The *Comments* panel will be displayed.
3.  If you attempt to edit the comment within the 2-minute timeframe, you'll see an action button next to the comment. Select the **Edit** button from the menu.
4.  Type the update to your comment and press **Update**. An edited status will show when an author updates a comment.
