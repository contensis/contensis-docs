Deleting a comment or conversation are similar actions, but you have to be the owner of the original comment or conversation to carry out the action. A `Delete any comment` action is available in roles to allow you to administer comments you haven't created.

## Delete an individual comment

If you want to delete a comment you have added to a conversation, follow these steps:

1.  Open an entry for editing or review.
2.  Press the **View/Add comment** button for the field you want to edit. The *Comments* panel will be displayed.
3.  Select the **Delete** button for the comment you want to delete.
4.  You must press **Delete comment** to confirm the deletion.

## Delete a conversation

When you want to remove the entire threaded conversation on a field, you'll need to be the original creator of the conversation.

1.  Open an entry for editing or review.
2.  Press the **View/Add comment** button for the field you want to edit. The *Comment*s panel will be displayed.
3.  If you are the owner of the conversation, you'll see a delete button at the top of the conversation.
4.  Press the **Delete** button for the conversation you want to delete.
5.  You must confirm the deletion by pressing **Delete conversation**.
