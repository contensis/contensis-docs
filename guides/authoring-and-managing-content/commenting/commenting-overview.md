The commenting feature in Contensis lets you add comments on fields in the entry editor, allowing you to collaborate with other Contensis users during the content lifecycle. Conversations can occur in each language variation of an entry, allowing different teams to collaborate in each locale.

## Commenting panel

A conversation button in the editor toolbar provides access to the various comments made in an entry. Conversations are listed by field name, allowing you to easily navigate to a specific conversation. You can also navigate to conversations you are part of or view previously resolved conversations.

## Field comment indicator

Each field in the entry editor has a comment button authors can use to either add a comment or navigate to an existing conversation. Where a conversation has started, a badge indicates the number of conversations.

## Commenting limitations

-   An entry needs to be saved before you can start a conversation.
-   An author can only add a conversation to a field.
-   Each comment in a discussion is limited to 2048 characters.
-   Conversations on array fields like composers, repeatables and components are made on the parent field, not the sub-fields.
-   Commenting on a text selection is not currently supported.
