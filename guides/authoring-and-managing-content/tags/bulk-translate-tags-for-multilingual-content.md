Contensis supports translating tags into different languages, helping you maintain consistent multilingual content across your project. This article shows how to bulk translate tags using the translation editor.

1.  From the *Tags listing* screen, select the checkboxes next to the tags you want to translate.
2.  Click the **Translate tags** option in the bulk actions toolbar.
3.  The split view translation editor will open, showing:
    
    -   A column of your original labels
    -   A column containing input fields for the translation
    

## Translating values

You can quickly translate your values in the translation column, by typing your value and tabbing through the fields with the keyboard.

You can also switch the language you are translating by using the language dropdown above the translation column.

Once your translations are complete, they'll be saved and used wherever tags are displayed in that language.

## Quick actions

A number of quick actions are available to speed up the translation of values.

-   **Copy a single label**: Use the copy button next to a tag to copy its text into the target language field. This is great when you are translating similar languages with regional differences, such as from French to French Canadian, for example.
-   **Copy all labels**: If you are translating multiple tags you can use the bulk copy option to fill all fields at once.
