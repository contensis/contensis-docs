Adding a tag field to a content type allows content authors to apply structured tags to entries –making it easier to organise, filter, and manage content across your project. Authors will see a tag input linked to the selected group when creating or editing entries.

1.  Fom the **Content modelling** menu in the sidebar, navigate to **Content types**.
2.  Choose an existing content type, or create a new one that you'd like to add tags to.
3.  To add the tag field, select **Tags** from the toolbox.
4.  -   Set a field **Name** *(e.g., Topics* or *Categories*).
    -   Choose the **Tag group** that the field should use.
    -   If required, set an [Item count](/help-and-docs/guides/modelling-content/validation/limit-a-field-to-a-specific-number-of-items-using-item-count) validation to limit the number of tags an author can select.
    
    Configure the tag field:
5.  Once you've configured the tag field, **Save** and then **Publish** the content type to apply your changes.
