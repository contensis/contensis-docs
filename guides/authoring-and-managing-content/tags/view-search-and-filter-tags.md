When working with large tag sets, filtering and sorting help you find and manage tags efficiently. This article outlines how to use these features in the tag listing screen.

## Keyword filter

Locate a specific tag by entering a **keyword** into the search bar. The tag listing will automatically update to show results where the keyword appears in the tag label.

## Filter by language

If your project has a **multilingual license**, tags can be translated into any of your enabled project languages.

-   Use the **language dropdown** to switch the tag listing to a specific language.
-   The **Translated** column will indicate whether each tag has been translated in the selected language.

## Filter by tag group

When you enter the tag listing screen, you’ll see a list of **All tags** by default. To narrow the list:

-   Use the **Tag group filters** in the search panel.
-   Selecting a group will update the list to show only the tags from that group.

## Sort tags

You can sort the tag list by clicking any column header in the table. The list can be sorted by:

-   Tag label
-   Translated
-   Usage
-   Tag group
-   Last updated date
