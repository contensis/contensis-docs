You can manage how Contensis looks to you by setting a theme preference that either follows your system settings or always uses a light or dark mode.

For choice and flexibility in how and when you use Contensis, you can configure theme settings to change how Contensis looks to you. You can choose from themes that are light or dark, or you can configure Contensis to follow your system settings.

You may want to use a dark theme to reduce power consumption on certain devices, to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions, or because you prefer how the theme looks.
