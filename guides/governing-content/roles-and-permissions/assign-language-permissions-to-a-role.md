If you have a multilingual license and a content type that has [additional supported languages](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/content-types/enable-or-disable-languages-for-a-content-type), it is possible to assign language-based permissions to a role.

This is useful if you want to create roles that enable translators to manage entries in a language that is not the default project language.

## Add a language permission

With a role open for editing and an entry permission selected, the permissions panel will be displayed, highlighting any entry permissions that have already been set up.

1.  Scroll to the bottom of the entry permissions panel and a list of languages will be displayed for the selected content type.
2.  Toggle the languages on and off that are required for this role and press **Save**.

If you want this role to be able to manage content in all languages – and any future languages that may be added to the content type – then set the *All languages* toggle to on. This will hide the list of languages from the panel and give permission for all languages.
