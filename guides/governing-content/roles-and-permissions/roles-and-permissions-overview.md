Permissions to create and manage a Contensis resource are determined by user being assigned to a role or a member of a system group.

## System group permissions

The following system groups give global permission for the resource across all projects in a Contensis instance. They are outlined below, and in more detail in our [Contensis system groups](/help-and-docs/guides/managing-users/groups/contensis-system-groups) article.

-   System Administrators
-   API Key Administrators
-   Site View Administrators
-   Roles Administrators
-   User Administrators

## Roles based permissions

Roles are a way of granting groups of users in your organisation permission to perform certain actions on specific resources of a project. This enables you to separate the duties within your team and provide users with exactly the amount of access that they need to do their job.

If a user is a member of multiple projects, they can have different roles for each project.

### Supported resources

The permissions for the following resources can be assigned at the project level using the roles builder.
