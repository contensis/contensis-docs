Tab-level permissions allow administrators to finely control which tabs, and in turn their fields, are visible and editable by different roles.

-   **Simplify the editor's workflow**: an editor role might only need access to content-related tabs (General, Body) and not administrative tabs (Settings, SEO). By restricting access to non-essential tabs, the editor’s interface is cleaner and more intuitive.
-   **Advanced configurations for admins**: an admin role might need full access to all tabs, including advanced settings like configuration and integrations. Meanwhile, other roles can be restricted from these areas to avoid unintended changes.

## How to configure tab-level permissions

1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar. The *Settings menu* will open, revealing a number of options.
2.  Select **Roles** to open the *Roles listing screen*.
3.  Locate and open the role where you would like to set tab-level permissions.
4.  Select the **Tabs** permissions from the toolbox. A new permission will be added to the list.
5.  The permission you've added will be active and the *Permissions* panel for the selected permission will be displayed.
6.  Choose the *Content type* from the permissions panel that you want to apply tab permissions on.
7.  Turn off the tabs that the user should not be able to edit.
8.  **Save** your changes. The new permissions will be immediately reflected in the user interface for users with the specified role.

## Permissioning individual fields

If you need to restrict editing of specific fields, you can use field-level permissions to restrict the editing of the content in the entry editor.

## Recommendations and limitations

-   **Workflow impact:** Users of a role with tab-level permissions applied will not be able to move the content into a new workflow stage where required validations apply.
-   **Testing:** Ensure you test your permission model with real user journeys to ensure team members can fulfil their role.
