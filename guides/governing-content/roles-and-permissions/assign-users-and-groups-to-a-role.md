Once a role has been set up and permissions have been configured, you can begin to add users or groups of users to the role.

With your role opened for editing:

1.  Select the **Users and groups** tab. A set of dropdown lists will be displayed for both users and groups.
2.  Type a user name or group name into the respective search box to begin locating the users or groups you would like to add.
3.  Select the user or group from the list by pressing on the item or by using the up and down arrow keys and confirming with the enter key.
4.  Once you are happy with the assignment, press **Save**. If your role is enabled, those users and groups will have immediate access to the resources specified in the permissions.

## Should I assign users or groups?

How you choose to assign users to your roles will depend on your organisation and its governance model. We suggest creating groups for your users where they may be assigned to multiple roles. This will make assignments easier to manage.

Where a small team exists to manage content, you may find it easier to add users to the role.
