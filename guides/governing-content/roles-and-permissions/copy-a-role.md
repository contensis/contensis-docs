If you find yourself needing to recreate a similar role to one that already exists, you can copy an existing role from the role editor. You'll need to be a member of the *Role Administrators* security group to do this.

1.  Open the role you want to copy by selecting it in the *Role listing*.
2.  When the *Role editor* opens, press the **Action** button from the role toolbar.
3.  Press **Copy** from the menu.
4.  The role will be copied and opened for editing. The new role will have '- copy' appended to its name.
5.  You'll need to update the name for your new role and update any permissions.
6.  **Save** the changes to your role to make the permissions available.
