Composer permissions are a special type of field-level permission that allow you to control the types of content that can be added, updated and arranged in a composer by different roles.

## How to configure composer permissions

1.  Press the **Settings** button in the sidebar. The *Settings menu* will open, revealing a number of options.
2.  Select **Roles** to open the *Roles listing screen*.
3.  Locate the role where you would like to set composer permissions.
4.  Select the **Fields** permissions from the toolbox. A new permission will be added to the list.
5.  The permission you've added will be active and the *Permissions* panel for the selected permission will be displayed.
6.  Choose the *Content type* from the permissions panel that you want to apply field level permissions on.
7.  The fields of the content type will be displayed, grouped by their relevant tabs. Composers are displayed differently to standard fields, showing an edit button.
8.  Pressing the edit button, a window will open for configuring fields within the composer.
9.  From the field permissions window, you can choose if a user can order items, or alternatively manage specific field types by turning fields on or off.
10.  **Confirm** your changes and **Save** the role settings. The new permissions will be immediately reflected in the user interface for users with the specified role.

## Permissioning groups of fields

If you need to restrict a large number of fields, you may find it easier to set up tab-level permissions, which can remove an entire group of fields in the entry editor.

## Recommendations and limitations

-   Users of a role with field level permissions applied will not be able to move the content into a new workflow stage where any required validations apply.
-   Ensure you test your permission model with real user journeys to ensure team members can fulfill their role.
