In order for an API key to access resources in your project you'll need to assign an API key to a role. If you have not created an API key you can follow our [article](/help-and-docs/user-guides/environment/api-keys/create-an-api-key) to create one.

With your role opened for editing:

1.  Select the **API keys** tab. A search box will be displayed.
2.  Type the name of an API key in the search box to locate the API key you would like to add.
3.  Select the API key from the list by pressing on the item or by using the up and down arrow keys and confirming with the enter key.
4.  Once you are happy with the assignment, press **Save**. If your role is enabled, the API key will have immediate access to those resources specified in the permissions tab.
