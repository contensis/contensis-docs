The life cycle of an [entry](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/authoring/entries/entries-overview) is controlled by the workflow assigned to the [content type](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/content-types/content-types-overview) that the entry is based on.

Contensis supports two standard workflows:

-   **Basic** – allows content to be authored and then published instantly.
-   **Approval** – allows content to be authored and submitted for approval before it is made live.

Entries are by default assigned to the basic workflow, but this can be changed by specifying a different [workflow](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/content-modelling/content-types/change-the-workflow-of-a-content-type) type.
