### Basic workflow

The basic workflow allows content to be authored and then published instantly. Each publish results in the entry being version complete, any subsequent change is considered as a new version of the entry.

#### Example

1.  An author creates an entry.
2.  They make multiple changes to the entry whilst in the *In progres*s state.
3.  The author publishes the entry, it is moved into the *Done* state, and is subsequently published. The version number of the entry is updated and that completes that version of the entry.
4.  The lifecycle of the entry is complete until any changes are made, beginning a new version.

### Approval workflow

The approval workflow allows content to be authored and sent for approval before it is made live. Once created, the entry is in the *In progress* state. Once it's ready for review, the author can send the entry for approval.

The entry can then be approved, moving it to the *Done* state, and resulting in a publish. If the entry fails review then the entry can be declined moving it to the *Declined* state along with a message to explain why.

If an author inadvertently sends an entry for approval the entry can be revoked and edited, returning it to the *In progress* state.

As with the basic workflow, each publish results in the entry being version complete. Any subsequent change is considered as a new version of the entry.

#### Example

1.  An author creates an entry.
2.  The author sends the content for approval.
3.  An approver reviews the entry, and declines the entry due to a number of grammatical errors. The approver provides a message to explain why they are declining the content.
4.  The entry remains in the declined state until an author makes the appropriate changes and resends the content for approval.
5.  The Approver reviews the entry and approves the changes to the content. Approving the entry results in the entry being moved to the *Done* state and publishes it.
6.  The lifecycle of the entry is complete until any changes are made, beginning a new version.
