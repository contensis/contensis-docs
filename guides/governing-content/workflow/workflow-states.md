The following entry workflow states represent the states that are possible in the [standard workflows](https://www.contensis.com/help-and-docs/user-guides/governance/workflow/types-of-workflow) that ship with Contensis.

### In progress

When an entry is created it will be in the *In progress* state until it has been published.

### Awaiting approval

When an entry is part of the approval workflow and has been sent for approval, then the entry will be in the *Awaiting approval* state.

There are three actions that can occur when an entry is in the *Awaiting approval* state:

-   **Approve** – the approver accepts the content, and it is approved for publishing.
-   **Decline** – the approver declines the content in review and it is transitioned into the *Declined* state for an author to make the appropriate changes and re-submit before the content can be published.
-   **Revoke and edit** – the author needs to make a change to the entry after sending the content for approval. Revoking and editing the entry moves it back into the *In progress* state, allowing the entry to be edited.

### Declined

When an entry is part of the approval workflow and has been declined, then the entry will be in the *Declined* state.

When the entry is viewed, the entry activity panel is displayed in the entry editor. The decline message is shown, outlining the reason that the content was declined.

### Done

When an entry has been completed and the entry has been approved or published, the entry will be moved into the *Done* state. This indicates the end of the entry's lifecycle for that version.

Content in the *Done* state will usually be published. However in future versions of Contensis, content may be in the *Done* state but assigned to a release schedule, be unpublished, or archived.

The published column in the entry listing indicates if a particular entry is published or not.

## Language statuses

### Never translated

When a language variation exists and its content has not yet been created the entry will have the *Never translated* state.

### Available for translation

When a language variation has a published version and changes to the default language have been made the entry will have the *Awaiting translation* state.

### Out of date

When a language variation's default language is updated, the entry will have the *Out of date* state.
